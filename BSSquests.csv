Nice to see you again!
Let's do a quick review
Just stopped by to say Hi
Welcome to this world, young one. I am <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Kikibiassa</FONT>, the eldest of the 3 sisters that will teach you how to survive. The monsters  known as the Umbra will show no mercy, even to a young Warrior such as yourself. Would you like to learn about the basics?
How to Chat
How to interact with others
What is the Hunter Stone?
About master/pupil
It was nice talking to you!
Communication is the key to becoming a true Warrior and protector of Luciena. Talking with your friends, allies, guild mates and the numerous people you'll meet will often lead to new discoveries, help you further your skills, or embark on new adventures. So let's get started!
Let's bring up the Chat Interface. See the 1, 2, and 3 sections? They represent <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Channel Select</FONT>, <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Symbol</FONT>, and <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Channel Filter</FONT>. These areas are where your messages are going to appear.
Typing is a snap. Check out this picture.<PF>You can <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>click this with your mouse</FONT>, or <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>press the Enter key</FONT>to activate the chat field. Afterwards, just type in your words and press Enter, and other players around you will see  your message.
Going down the list, let's start with section 1, Channel Select.  We can change channels via he function key. The channels are <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>General</FONT>,  <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Whisper (for private chats)</FONT>, <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Party Channel</FONT>, <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Guild Channel</FONT>, and the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Master and Pupil channel</FONT>.
Next we have the Channel Filter. There are some messages you want to see and some you may not want to see. You can use this function to filter them. For example, you may not want to bothered by someone, then you can remove the 'General Channel'. <pf>Afterwards, you will not see any other messages from other players. Go with the option that  works best for you!
As far as Symbols, you use them for chatting!  In addition to selecting them directly, you can just enter the symbols on your keyboard for the right expression!
Please remember that while chatting, you can not use any hotkeys. If you want to use your hotkeys, click anywhere except the Chat interface on your screen.  If you have something important to say to your friend, it's better to go somewhere safe first, unless you become so adept at killing the Umbra that you can switch back and forth!
You can access additional options by moving your cursor and right-clicking on any player. A menu will show up, and you can invite the player to talk, trade, or, even better, invite him/her  to your Friends List.  I'd recommend that you add at least 4 friends as soon as possible. Five fingers are weak separately, yet as one, they form a fist!
You can find a fabulous shiny totem in every village. It's known as the 'Hunter Stone'!
What does it do?
The 'Hunter Stone' provides a way for players to form parties and battle the Umbra. It was created by the mighty minds of <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Neo Machina</FONT>, which you'll learn more about later. <pf>To use the Hunter Stone, you have to<FONT COLOR=#00ff00> Setup Search Key Words</FONT>. For example, you can check who wants to join a arty, what his/her level is, and current classes.
After you finish setup, press <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Search!</FONT> You'll get your results, a list of fellow adventurers who are looking for parties. Be sure to team up, you never know what can happen when you combine attacks...
What's 'Party Status Setting'?
You need to turn on this function before joining a party. After that, it's happy hunting.</Text>
How do I use it?
Select it, and choose your conditions for a party. Give it a hot when you have a chance, it's pretty simple.

Master and Pupil is a system that allows a ore experienced Warrior to take a pupil, and assist in training them to combat Umbra.</Text>
You can click on <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>C</FONT> to open the Status window. For more details, talk to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Rumile</FONT>. If you have a aster or a pupil, (Must be over Level 40 and talk to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Houshu</FONT>), you can see list of <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Masters and Pupils</FONT> when you open the Status window.
When Master and Pupil form a party together, the pupil can gain more experience. After finishing the battle, the pupil can have <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Bonus Points</FONT>. When you have enough  Bonus Points, you can get a cool title!
Of course, the master benefits as well. If a aster takes an adventurer under level 40 as a pupil, the master can gain Bonus Points as well. When these Bonus Points accumulate high enough, the Master can also gain something, such as special name or something extra...
Well, we have an old saying around Luciena, the brightest light will cast the darkest shadow. Be careful of the path you walk, for you never know where it can lead you.  You are free to make your own choices, be sure to make the ones that benefit us all.
Thank you! You are so nice! A cruel soul deserves no rewards...
Oh! <FONT COLOR=#ffad5b>You are so nice</FONT>!
Looks like you're making good progress. It is time to explore the past of this world...visit  Gemba, and she shall weave the tale of conflict that envelops Luciena.
Hey, nice to see you again. Have you visited everyone in the village yet?
Beginner's Advisors?
Still exploring!
Yes, they are Item Master <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Doug</FONT>, Traveler's Handbook and Log Instructor <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Teresa</FONT>, Skill Instructor <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Miyabi</FONT>, Character Instructor <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Lumier</FONT>, and Map Instructor <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Cauchy</FONT>. They are around the village. I'm sure you won't miss them!
After you finish your courses, come see me. That's when you'll be ready to explore beyond the boundaries of this Village.
No problem, you can come see me whenever you're ready.
Young traveler, welcome to Luciena. I am known as Basic Instructor <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Kikibiassa</FONT>. You must have a lot of questions! I will help guide you to your chosen destiny. Also, if you finish my courses you will be rewarded!   Are you interested?
Yes, it's time to train!
I am an expert. No, thanks!
Ok, we can start basic classes any time.  Speak with me when you're ready.
If you are not interested, I won't push you.

You want to go over everything again?
Let's review
My path grows difficult...
Which aspect of &lt;FONT COLOR=#00ff00&gt;Character Growth&lt;/FONT&gt; do you want to learn?
Character Data
Upgrades and Rewards
Obtaining/Setting a title
The Awakening
I've got crazy skills already!
Understanding your ability is important! Press <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>C</FONT> to open a window. Of course, you can click on the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Spirit Button on the bottom left side of your screen</FONT>. Both of those options will open a menu. You can also check your current character status that way.
What you can see now is the advanced character status!  In addition to the information on the <FONT COLOR=#ffad5b>upper left side of the screen</FONT>, you can see <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Title</FONT>, <FONT COLOR=#00ff00> Awakening</FONT>, and<FONT COLOR=#00ff00> Status Abilities</FONT>. Other specific functions are<FONT COLOR=#00ff00> Set Title</FONT>, <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Awakening Status</FONT>, and <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Character Reward Points</FONT>.
When your experience reaches a certain point, you will gain additional strength, health, magicand Soul Power. You will also get some <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Ability Points</FONT>. You can use these points to modify your skills--STR, INT, CON, AGI, WIS, and DEX. Open your Character Window, and you'll see it at the bottom.
<FONT COLOR=#00ff00>You'll earn experience by completing tasks, hunting umbra and seeking out the umbra airs for adventures with your friends</FONT>. Of course, when you complete a task, you have a chance to get bonus items...
You can show off your experience through your titles! You'll get a title for completing different  tasks, such certain Umbra being vanquished, helping others, launching Soul Power Attacks, you name it!  There are many tasks within the world, and the collective leaders of Luciena ill often add  Titles for the adventurers that continue to defeat Umbra.
So how do I get Titles?

Open your Character Data Window, then click the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Set Title</FONT> button, you will see all your titles.
Point to the title you want to change, <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Left-click to confirm</FONT>, and you're done!

You seemed to have finished all of your lessons, congratulations! If you go to the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Trial Field</FONT>, you'll see <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Basic Battle Instructor Kite</FONT> who will teach you the basics of battles, and how to best fight against the Umbra.
Hmmm...you seem to not have taken training yet. If you're interested, I recommend going to the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Kikibiassa sisters</FONT> near the fountain.
Basic Battle Instructor Kite
Basic battle instructor Kite will teach you the basic of combat. Study well!
If you want to learn more about battle techniques, standing next to me is <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Silspear</FONT>, an  intermediate battle instructor who specializes in skills. You should learn from him.
So you've come! I would like you to take Second Level Training. Do you want to listen?
Yes, please tell me everything.
Perhaps later...
On the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>beach</FONT> to the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>East</FONT> of this<FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Trial Field</FONT>, the Umbra now occupy the shore. Not only that, but they seem to be robbing things from the villagers. <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Gob</FONT> is a monster that takes everything by force. Can you assist the villagers by clearing the beach?
Perfect, I'm ready for a fight!
Gob's never hurt me, so...No.
Excellent! I'll await the good news!
If only we had more people, I didn't want to cause you trouble...
Alright, I guess I'll ask someone else.
Hmmm? So you want to move onto the second level of basic battle training? Then I will give you one mission. Complete the mission with success to prove to me you've mastered what I have taught.<PF>Recently, there's been Umbra round the entrance of the village. I say Umbra but they're not that bad, just defeat them so they don't come close to the village. Defeat <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Slime Jelly</FONT> near the entrance of the village and report to me. Want to give it a try?
I'll do my best!
No thanks!
Great. I'll be waiting for your report. Good luck!
Alright, I can't force you. As long as you understand what I have taught, its ok.
So, you seem to be interested in level 2 of the basic battle training... Then I will give you one mission. First, I'll give you <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>5 Small Red Potions</FONT>. When you successfully complete this mission, that proves you've learned my lesson. <PF>Recently, there's been Umbra sightings around the entrance of the village. Head out there and make sure that they don't get any closer to the village. Defeat <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Slime Jelly</FONT> near the entrance of the village and report to me. Are you ready?
Yep! I'm off!
On second thought...
Great. I'll be waiting for your report. Good luck!
You inventory seems to be <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>full</FONT>. Clean up your bag and come back.
Alright, I can't force you. As long as you understand what I have taught, its ok.
Hey! Glad to see you again. I suppose you know nothing about fighting. You want to learn first or take the test directly?
I'm willing to learn!
It's test time!
Alright! The first thing I want to teach you is how to use the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Quick Menu</FONT>......
Alright! First let's talk about how to use <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Sshortcuts</FONT>... <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Sshortcuts</FONT> are the two rows of icons at the bottom of the screen. The left being <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Function Sshortcuts</FONT> that allow you to quickly open <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Functions</FONT>. On the right are the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>General Sshortcuts</FONT>. These are used to quickly access <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Skills</FONT> and <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Items</FONT>. I'll explain how to set up General Sshortcuts.<PF>First, open the Item Window, and <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>drag</FONT> an item into the general sshortcut bar. That's it! Isn't it easy? The same goes for skills, by opening the skill window and <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>dragging</FONT> a kill to the sshortcut bar.
Hotkeys are assigned to your keyboard from <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>F1</FONT> to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>F12</FONT>. You can assign your hotkeys to skills or tools. For example, if you drag the icon of medicine to F1, you can push F1 to use medicine when you need. After medicine is used up, you can only recover HP and MP slowly by waiting.
Remember when you click on <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>single target</FONT> it will locate the target <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>and attack</FONT>, and you will see its <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Icon</FONT>, <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>level</FONT> and <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>HP</FONT>. Be sure to watch your target's strength before you attack...it could save your life. After you decide to fight, click on the target and you will approach until you're in range and attack. You will see the effects immediately during the battle as both of you get weaker and lose HP.
My class is over. If you want to continue, please come to see me again. It will not only be  training, but you will also help the villagers! More importantly, you will be <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>rewarded</FONT>!
......
What are you worried about?
I know the hotkeys!
Well, since you already know how to use hotkeys, I'll let you go on your way. If you still have questions, you can look for the answers in Beginner's Village or ask other players. <FONT COLOR=#ffad5b>Can you come again later?</FONT> I have something for you to do...
Alright, take care.
Battle instructor Silspear
Intermediate battle instructor Silspear basic conversation
Young Warrior, I do expect you to grow and help us protect Luciena.
Oh! I knew you will come to me! I have a request to ask you.
What's that?
No thanks
Well, we have a new visitor in Taral Field! But this new visitor doesn't talk to others. Could you ask him what he is doing here for me? He may need your help. If so, take this chance to train yourself.
You gotta help me!
I am sure you will become stronger and you can fight with stronger Umbra soon.  Do you want to take this challenge?
Sure!
I need some rest...
I believe that you are a brave adventurer!   Deep breath first. After making your thinking clear, come and talk to me again!
Come to me again when you are ready!
Hey there, we meet up again. Are you ready for <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>training level 3</FONT>?
Yes!
I'm just passing by!
Good! Good! I think you already know that there are Umbra n the Trial Field. Actually, the level 3 training is easy. Just go to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>the north of Trail Field</FONT>. You can see <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Chuckey</FONT> there. Yes! I think you know the rule. If you can defeat <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Chuckey</FONT>, I will give you a reward. Remember to make use of your skills when you fight with them.
Alright!
I don't want to do that!
I will wait for good news from you.
Okay, I will ask others for help if you don't want to earn the money.
As you wish...
Hey, we met again. I guess you want to know about <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>3rd training</FONT>, right?
Yes!
Not yet!
Good! Good! You know there is a monster called <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Little Mr. Water Drop</FONT>, which lives in the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>north of East Coast</FONT> at <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Trail Field</FONT>?<PF>Well, this mission is very easy. I just want you to defeat <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Little Mr. Water Drop</FONT>. You'll need to make use of your skill to defeat it. The purpose of this quest is to help you become familiar with the skills you know. Of course, I will give you a <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>reward</FONT> after you clear the mission.
Skill and Will--I'm ready!
I don't feel like fighting
Oh, I mentioned the Soul Explosion to you before but I want to tell you more about this powerful technique.
Usually, soul power is green, but sometimes you will see some different colors. The Umbra seem to know what they mean, but we do not understand it fully. All we know is that we can utilize it for a burst of power.
The Soul Explosion meter is on the right side of the character info window. There are five levels, you can't use it before they are ALL full.
Then?
Then, the meter will flash, and you're ready to use it!
The grey button on the bottom will flash as well! Click it to enter explosive status--use it when you need it!
Ok, then you can look after the Little Mr. Water Drops near the sea. Let me adjust your Soul Spark so you can use the explosion...there. Try it!
Ok, I will find another brave soul for the reward.
Okay, comeback any time when you want to continue with the training.
Yeah, kid, are you with <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Kite</FONT>, who helps with progressive battle training?
Yes
Nope
Thank you for coming. Young people don't like studying any more these days... Let's start it. Do you know how to tell between <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Aggressive</FONT> and <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Passive</FONT> Umbra?  Yeah, I think you can tell, it's pretty simple, <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>click on a single target</FONT> then you will see the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>target window</FONT>. It will display the target's <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>name</FONT>, <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>level</FONT> and <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>HP</FONT>.<PF>The target's <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>level</FONT> will appear in different background colors so you can tell.
If the color is <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>green</FONT>, the target is <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>a layer</FONT>, it is <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>passive</FONT> if the color is <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>yellow</FONT>,  and <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>red</FONT> means it is <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Aggressive</FONT> target. Watch for the signs and you can take measures to defend yourself. Never come close to them without being prepared!
What? you seem bored although they are important. Well then, let's cover <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>using Skills</FONT>, ok? If you want to use your skills quickly in the battle, you need to assign them to your <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>hotkeys</FONT>. First of all, open the Skill window, choose a kill and <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>drag</FONT> it to the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>first hotkey box,</FONT> which is <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>F1</FONT>, and then you can use your skill by pressing the hotkey.
Wait, besides magic skills, you also need <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Soul Power</FONT>. Have you heard about it?
In order to get Soul Power, you need to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>defeat Umbra</FONT>, then you will find <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>souls</FONT>. The maximum souls you can collect is different by levels. It goes up when you take your strength to a new level. Soul Power helps you <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>use skills</FONT>, <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>learn skills</FONT> or <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>create items</FONT>. Did you understand?
Ok, you can go out practice now and come back later for further training.
Whatever, it's up to you.
Heh, I can tell that you haven't gone through <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>basic battle training</FONT>, you'd better find <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Kite </FONT>to finish your classes first!

Congratulations on passing the test. Now, go to the Trial Cave and have a preacher named <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Daltanian</FONT> transfer you. If you want to be a Warrior or Machinist, go to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Meteor Pit</FONT>, or if you want to be a Mage or Shaman, go to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Thunder Hill</FONT>.
Please try hard to pass the Trial.
Young one, you seem to have trained a lot. Would you like to become even better?
I'm ready to go!
I've had enough for now...
You have a very strong will. You'll become a great hero! Now, you have 4 paths to choose from <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Warrior</FONT>, <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Machinist</FONT>, <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Mage</FONT>, and <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Shaman</FONT>. Do you know what each path is like?
Could you tell me?
I know everything!
Don't worry. I'll explain each of the 4 jobs to you. Which of them are you interested in?
Warrior
Mage
Others
For a Warrior, their belief in obtaining Soul Power is through <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Justice and Courage</FONT>. By calming their spirit in the heat of battle and focusing, they can apply Soul Power to their  weapon. In order to maximize their skill's effects, Warriors wield heavy weapons. To defeat their enemies, they must become strong in both spirit and body.<PF>Warriors belong to the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Order of Masamune</FONT>. They always fight their enemies fair and square, and always stand at the front lines of battle. Therefore only those with guts and strength are able to become Warriors.<PF>So, you want to be a Warrior?
The sword is my destiny!
Let me think for a sec!
Okay. Being a Warrior is a job that requires Justice and Courage, so I need you to prove that you have the courage necessary to become one.<PF>There are Umbra called <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Little Frankens</FONT> in the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Trial Cave</FONT> to the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Northwest of Trial Field</FONT>, who love to do evil things. If you could get rid of them, I think the villagers here will be very thankful. If you succeed in this, it will prove that you have the courage and skill necessary to become a Warrior.
I'll prove it to you! I'm off!
Not my style, sorry.
Now please go and defeat <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Little Franken</FONT> in the cave.
Really? I thought you had potential, that's too bad.
Really? I thought you had potential, that's too bad.
When defeating Umbra, many choose to use physical attacks.  However, some Umbra cannot be defeated with simple melee.<PF>Basically, there are many types of Umbra. So, when faced with such a monster, you'll need the power of a Mage, the philosophy of the Sorcerer Society. They have the skill to convert Soul Power into attacks, and are thus especially good against Umbra with high Soul Power.<PF>Mages <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>are highly destructive</FONT>, and can even defeat enemies with one hit. They can deal damage to enemies without even approaching them, and though they do not have the strong spirit and body of a Warrior, they have unparalleled magic power, powered by their very will. So it is impossible to become a Mage without a powerful mind.<PF>So, you want to be a <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Mage</FONT>?
Yes!
Let me think for a sec
Very well. With such a strong will, I'm sure you'll make a great Mage. Let's test if you are actually worthy of being a age.<PF>In the monster's nest, <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Trial Cave</FONT> to the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Northwest of Trial Field</FONT>, there is a monster named <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Little Mr. Arlys</FONT>. These Umbra re such evil things. If you can defeat them, I will accept you as a Mage. Be wise in your journey...
Arlys? I think I ate there once
No way, it's not for me.
I can sense your intelligence from your eye. Now go inside the cave and defeat <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Little Mr. Arly</FONT>.
I can't force you. But I think you are smart enough, and have the ability to pass the trial to become a Mage.
I can't force you, but I think you are smart enough and  have the ability to pass the trial to become a <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Mage</FONT>.
So what are you interested in?
Shaman
Machinist
Let me think for a sec.
Harmony with nature, this is the philosophy of the Nature Collective. One must be born with sensitivity to communicate with nature. Shamans basically require this instinctive skill.<PF>Shamans are the mediators between the Natural and Biological Worlds, using <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Soul Power</FONT> to weaken or strengthen a certain target's vitality. The Shaman's motto is to love nature and respect life.<PF>They don't carry weapons, and their strongest source of strength is their serenity with nature. The most important quality of a Shaman is an empathetic and loving personality.<PF>So, you want to be a <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Shaman</FONT>?
I sense beauty around us!
Let me think for a sec.
Excellent. Such a quick response. I see your heart is truly set on this. Well then, let me see if you are truly suited to being a Shaman.<PF>In the monster's nest, <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Trial Cave</FONT> to the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Northwest of Trial Field</FONT>, there are monsters named <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Little Mr. Arly</FONT>. These Umbra are such evil things. If you can defeat them, I will accept you as a <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Shaman</FONT>.
I'm on my way!
Whoa, not interested.
You seem to be confident. Now go and defeat <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Little Mr. Arly</FONT> in the cave.
Alright, lets meet again. Let me say one thing, I think you have natural talent. If you just had the will, I don't think there would be a problem.
Alright, lets meet again. Let me say one thing, I think you have natural talent. If you just had the will, I don't think it was a problem.
Mm? The path of science and discovery? Yes, there are people out there who dedicate their lives to invention.<PF>These people excel in <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Neo Machina</FONT>. They believe that everything in this world can be explained through science, even Umbra.<PF>However, many of them aren't particularly athletic, and don't have the skills to properly defend themselves. So they, when faced with an enemy, develop weapons that will allow them to fight from a distance, getting the upper hand in combat. This allows them to defeat the Umbra without putting themselves at risk. As a result, they are known as <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Machinists</FONT>.<PF>So, you want to be an Machinist?
E=MC squared, I'm in!

Tiny Umbra, no problem!

Congratulations! You finished the test!
Map Info, please
I can get around fine!
What do you want to know about the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Map</FONT>?
Map Summary
Small Map
Mark Location
Firstly, you have to learn how to open the Map.
How can I open the Map?
It is easy. Just click on the little map on the top of your screen. The icon is on the right side. Of course, you can use a hotkey, 'M' to open the map.
What does map say?
You can know the topography and the location of entrance to another map. If you're in a party, you can see where your party members are. Of course, there is a function to<FONT COLOR=#00ff00> Memorize Location</FONT> via large map.
What does this do?
This is another instruction, you can read it later!
Small map is set to open, it is located on the upper right corner!
What are these buttons?
These buttons affect Map and Zoom options!
What do the color buttons do?
Magnifying Glass?
+ and -?
Got it!
Red, green, yellow and blue buttons are set to open, then close on the second click. They are monster (red), non-player character (green), teammate (yellow) and player (blue). When they are active, you will find them on the map.
Like I said, you just select the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Magnifying Glass icon</FONT>, and you can open the large map and click again to close it!
Also, you can tell day and night from the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Sun</FONT> and <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Moon</FONT> icon.
This is Zoom. Click on + and it will zoom in, and clicking on - will zoom out.
Also, <FONT COLOR=#ffad5b>if you move your mouse on the small map</FONT> to the place you want to go and right click</FONT>, <FONT COLOR=#ffad5b>your spirit will guide you all the way there</FONT>.
About this <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Memorize Location</FONT> function, it allows you to bookmark your favorite locations, you get one  default set and you can <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>expand up to 20 sets</FONT>. Using this transportation function requires  <FONT COLOR=#ffad5b>a certain item</FONT>.
How do I expand it?
If you want to expand memory, you need to go to the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>ItmeMall</FONT> to buy <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Transportation Expansion Scrolls</FONT>. It helps you a lot, although you don't have to buy it.
You just mentioned medium...
Yeah, transportation will use <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>one Saved Point Transmission Scroll</FONT>. If you want you can go to the  <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>ItmeMall</FONT> to buy.
Wow, I can't wait!
Orientation is very important!
It's hard, are you ready?
Absolutely!
Hold on...
Then you can find me later, ok?
Ok, later.

How's are you doing? Do you want to learn about Items?
Yes! Tell me about items!
Check your backpack
What do you want to learn about <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>item</FONT>?
Item Interface Overview
Item explanation
Storage space
Put on/take off outfit
I don't wanna learn anything!
Click on the Spirit Button on <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>the bottom of your screen</FONT>. Then choose <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>item</FONT> from the menu. Also, you can just press <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>B</FONT> on your keyboard.
What's next?
When you want to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>move</FONT> an item to a different page, you can just <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>drag and drop</FONT> the  item icon to the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>page tag</FONT> at the top of the window.<PF>Alternatively, if you drag the icon to the page tag and hold it there, you will switch to that page, so you can drop the item into an <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>empty slot</FONT>.
What if the bag is full?
Well, you can put the stuff you don't need to carry in a storehouse. What I want to teach you now  is how to clean up your backpack and make money.
Oh! Show me how!
Basiclly, you can find <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Weapon Store</FONT> or <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>weapon store boss</FONT>. They are business man. Remember, the boss will not trade for you. Only will trade for <FONT COLOR=#ffad5b>himself</FONT>. Do not trade with a wrong person!
When selling items, drag and drop the item you want to sell onto the window 1 shown above. Then a confirmation window like Window 2 will show. Item you sold will not come back so check it here before you sell it.
Every items have detail information, so you should know them before making any decisions!
How can I look details?
First, you right click on the item (equipped or in bag) and you will see its status and details.
For example, <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>[Unable to drop]</FONT> (can't discard it), <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>[Unable to sell]</FONT> (can't sell at stores)</FONT>, <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>[Untradeable]</FONT> (can't trade with other players) and so on.
What is Lock?
Good eyes! This <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Lock</FONT> is for some unfortunate, unlucky, and un...
Ok, just say it!
Ok, if your account was stolen, or you don't want your friend to use your account, this is handy because you can set your password on it. But I don't recommend you to share an account with your friend, anyway.
You can store your items in both your backpack and storage. Did you know that?
Obviously not
Yeah, if you want to use storage, you need to find a <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Storage Manager</FONT>.
What can I store in storage?
Almost everything you want to. Also, you should know that there is a <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>public storage</FONT> tab where  you can exchange items with your other characters!
Using Equipment is easy to learn. After you open your item, double click on it or drag its icon to your equipment window and there you go! But remember, there will be a profession limitation.
Are you sure you're alright?
Oh... Not good. My bag has a hole! I think I need a new one...
I wish my bag is bigger......    Oh, hello, I didn't see you coming. What's up?
I heard you teach something
You like your bag, don't you?
Oh! Did Kikibiassa tell you? Come to see me later. I need to clean it up....
Yeah, I like it.

About skills
No Thanks
What part do you want to learn about <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Skill</FONT>?
Skills summary
Learn, use, forget
How to use skills
No need, thanks
First, let's talk about how to open the Skills window.
"You can push the Spirit Button, then click Skill or push <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>S</FONT> to open the skills window.		NPC(?雅/NPCP0001.tga)	Quest	Quest.XML	9.Text4"
Found it!
Yeah, let me explain these numbers one by one, ok?
They are <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>time usage</FONT>, <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>MP usage</FONT> and <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>SP usage</FONT>. The small book on the right is <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>the estimate total SP usage</FONT>, and on the bottom is <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>target</FONT>. If the skill does not match the target, you can't use it.
Lets talk about these three buttons on the left. The left one is <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Learn</FONT>. You have to make sure your level and spirit is high enough to learn the skill.
Do I need to forget skills?
Yes, because the maximum number of skills for a character is <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>50</FONT>, you can't have more if you reach the limit unless you forget some skills, or go to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>ItmeMall</FONT> and buy tools such as the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Sacred Mountain Flower</FONT> to extend the limit.
You can learn the skill again if you have enough spirit.
How do I use skills?
It is possible by pressing the button in the middle, but also you can assign a shortcut key. I will tell you later.
The middle button at the bottom of the skill window has the function to use the chosen skill.
Do I need it opened?
No, you can drag your favorite skills to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>the hotkeys on the bottom right</FONT>, and then you can use them easily.
It's up to you whether coming to study or taking tests...
Alright! I hope you become a Hero!
Hey! What's up?
I heard you are an instructor!
Lava's backpack...
Yeah, I can share some tips I learned from the skills handbook.
Oh, I hate to see people distracted.

young one Tarisha onversation
Lebant is just the one who taught me how to open the Umbra Guide. Fortunately, I am clever  enough to help myself on the rest of it.
I want to review again
Do you still love Lebant?
You want to learn <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Umbra Guide </FONT>or <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Quest Log</FONT>?
Learn Umbra Guide first
Learn Quest Log first
Well then, let's both do our best! I hope that someday my Adventure Log becomes full, and I could tell my children and  grandchildren about them. Or maybe talk about it when I'm hanging out with friends.
How do I open Umbra Guide?
You probably know nothing about Umbra Guide. Push the Spirit Button, you will find that the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Umbra Guide</FONT> is greyed out. After Lebant teaches you about the book, this button will be active, and then you  can open the Umbra Guide. You can also push <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>V</FONT> key to open it!
What's inside it?
You will see categories, and when you get a ew monster card, its name will appear. Its level and card number will appear as well.
Click on one of the cards and you will see the monster's picture, level, description and card  number.
Let's go back to first page of the Umbra Guide. At the bottom of the window, you will see <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>page number</FONT>, <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>number of cards collected</FONT>, and buttons to switch between <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Umbra Guide</FONT> and <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Magic Square</FONT>.
What are they?
We have already talked about <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Umbra Guide</FONT> layout so I will explain about <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Magic Square</FONT>.
<FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Magic Square</FONT> is very useful too. The part that is numbered one is <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>card list</FONT>, the one in the middle is <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>the button to change card's functions</FONT>, the part that is numbered 2 is where you want to set your card layout.
And on the bottom left side is the effect summary of the layout.
Of course, you can add or remove cards as you like. When you change the magic card layout, it will affect the amount of SP you will use.
What's the difference?
The current layouts include Follow, Battle Summon, and Magic Cards.     <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Follow</FONT> is for bringing the Umbra ith you. <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Battle Summon</FONT> is for summoning a monster during battle <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Magic Card</FONT> is for increasing your power through the combination of cards.   Use your cards wisely!
What is fast summon...?
Yeah, you are smart kid. Let's go back to the first page of Umbra Guide. When you open a monster card, there is a unction called <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>fast summon</FONT>.
If you use<FONT COLOR=#00ff00> fast summon</FONT>, you will <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>use 2 monster cards</FONT>. Also, fast summon only apply to the Umbra rom<FONT COLOR=#00ff00> battle summon</FONT>.
What about MMagnifying Glass?
Smart as a hip--that's next on the list!
When you open a monster card, there will be a Magnifying Glass icon.
You can check out your monster by rotating it!
Isn't the Umbra Guide very interesting?
I forgot what I wanted to say... I'll let you know when I remember.
Quest Log keeps records of the tasks you completed. It includes the quests with experience and money rewards, quests in the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Meteor Pit</FONT> and <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Thunder Hill</FONT>, <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>everyday quests</FONT> from those organizations, and many others!
Where can I see it?
Sorry, I skipped. First of all, how to open quest log. Push Spirit Button on the left, then click Quest button to open it. Or you can simply press <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>T</FONT>  to open quest log.
What's inside it?
The first block on the top allows you to switch between <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>on going quests</FONT> and <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>completed  quests</FONT>. You can also look up the current tasks and completed tasks here. The maximum number of quests for a haracter is <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>50</FONT>.
In the next window under it, you can see its descriptions.
There are two buttons in block 3, one is <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Cancel Quest</FONT>, and the other one is <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Quest Instruction</FONT>. If you are not familiar with the quest, you can cancel it or you can <FONT COLOR=#ffad5b>Forget the quest</FONT>, <FONT COLOR=#ffad5b>and restart it</FONT>.  The hotkey for the quest instruction is <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>R</FONT>.
Understood!
Don't you have questions about the close button?
Close is close right?
Yeah, you are right.
Yeah, I invited<FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Meteor Pit</FONT>'s <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Roarin</FONT> and <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Ofilia</FONT> to paint a portrait and bake a cake. Wonder if he likes it.
There's a lot more to remember.
......quest log and Umbra Guide.
Lebant is just the one who taught me how to open the Umbra Guide. Fortunately, I am clever enough to figure out the rest.
You're an instructor?
Enjoy talking to yourself?
Yeah, I can share my research about Umbra Guide and the Quest Log, come find me later!
What's wrong with talking to myself?

Oh its you? I'm really saved, thanks. After that evil <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Soul Eater</FONT> vanished, the other Umbra disappeared too.
Young one, you... your power seems to be at such a higher level than I expected. Maybe you may be able to grant my wish. There's been one thing that has been bothering me all this time, but now that I'm old, there's nothing I can do myself. Would you like to know my wish?
Sure.
No thanks!
I told you that the reason I am a watcher here is to get revenge, right? Even now, 50 years since that day, the sight of my ravaged village and dead brother are burned into my eyes, still haunting me. That was the first time I felt my knees quake at the sight of the Umbra...one in particular. <PF>The other day, I was finally able to find and challenge that monster, but it was futile. I almost died there. I tried several times since, but I just can't defeat him. I suspect that he knows this, and merely toys with me...<PF>I don't know if I'm just too weak, or if fear holds me back, but I can't do it no matter how many times I try. Young one, could you defeat it and help avenge my brother?
Leave it to me!
Perhaps later...
Young one, how could I ever thank you. The skeleton is called a <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Soul Eater</FONT>, and he is a truly powerful opponent, so please be careful. One piece of advice though, there are many other scary Umbra around there besides the Soul Eater, so it would be safer to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>take 3 or more friends with you</FONT>.
Well, its not something easy to do. Come back when you change your mind.
That's too bad. I'll have to find another person.
Thanks for helping out last time young one. I have one <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>warning</FONT> for you, If you value your life, don't go deep into the cave. There are tons of strong Umbra called <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Soul Eater</FONT> living there.
Young one, you seem to be pretty tough. Seems like I have to give this job to the new generation. Do you know why I'm here?
Enlighten me.
Not interested.
Oh, well, I'll have to start with a certain disaster from <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>50 years ago</FONT>. At the time, I was still a beginner like you...<PF>I will never forget that cold winter night. When I came back from the excursion, the village was under attack. Terrifying creatures that  should never be, their very forms were a violation of nature. The Umbra. They appeared out of nowhere, destroyed the village, taking most of the people's lives with it. There were virtually none who survived the onslaught, including my own <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>brother</FONT>.<PF>In my agony, I vowed to find whoever did this and take revenge for my brother.<PF>Through research I found that those monsters had come from <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Trial Cave</FONT>. However, I was unable to track their roots, and was only able to  form a force field to seal them in. Ever since I saw the endless monsters in the cave, I became a <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>protector</FONT>, defending <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Beginner's Village</FONT> from any monsters that find their way out.<PF>This is my job. However, it would seem I've grown old. My body can no longer keep up. Can you defeat the monsters inside in my place?
I'm ready to take over.
That's not my business!
Thank you, young one. Enter the cave and defeat <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Dratch</FONT> to weaken their forces once and for all.
*Sigh* Time tends to make us forget all too quickly... Your generation barely knows about that tragedy.
...be careful. Don't enter the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>cave</FONT> again. Inside, there are tons of <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>ferocious</FONT> Umbra sealed.
Young one, no matter how much you desire, with your current skills, it is just too <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>dangerous</FONT> for you to proceed. Don't enter yet...

The courage of certain beings allows them to obtain 'Soul Power' from their inner strength as a kind of silent prayer, and use weapons that are blessed with 'Soul Power' to fight Umbra. These people are Warriors. Are you one of them? Do you know where Soul Power comes from?
Belief!
A backpack!
Correct! 'Belief' is the source of Soul Power! Are you ready?
I am ready!
Give me a minute...
Knives, swords, and axes that are blessed...no, empowered, by Soul Power are the common weapons of a Warrior. I heard that <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Holy Plain</FONT> <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>a?瞽Fa??a癒禮瞽Da癒M?a?癒X</FONT>owns <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>a?瞽Fa??a瞽G'</FONT> a??a癒M? <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>a?瞽X-?c?3</FONT> , if you can give them to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>a?癒禮?瞿ga-癒Ma?'?癒Pc3癒?</FONT>, he can make it to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>a?瞽X-?a癒V癒簣</FONT>. a?瞽X-?a癒V癒簣 is my dream. Please help me.
So you are not brave enough to prove yourself! I hope you can find your courage! Come on, young Warrior!
So you do not know your profession very well. Warrior's spirit comes from 'Belief'! You disappoint me!
Those who obtain Soul Power by using magic, and use this awesome power to fight Umbra are Mages. You harness this energy and combine it with unique spells to get Soul Power from nature. Am I right, Mage?
Mastery of Mana leads to insight.
Man, what?
You seem to know very well about your profession. But do you have the courage to prove yourself?
I am ready!
Give me a minute...
I know what you do with bats, but I have special feeling about bats! Especially about <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>bats</FONT> there are very precious <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>bat wings</FONT>, can you bring one to me? Incidentally, they are also quite tasty...
You seem not to have enough courage to prove yourself! I hope you find your inner mana mojo! Come on, young Mage!
You seem not to know your profession very well. You disappoint me!
Those who feel a connection with nature and obtain Soul Power from meditation. They use this to build life and spread a message of eternal peace throughout the land. They are known as Shamans. They understand nature, and thus, can direct certain forces to do their bidding. Shamans can weaken targets by reducing their Soul Power directly...and yet, you don't kill, you only drain them,, leaving them for the earth. Am I right, Shaman?
The Serenity of Nature calms us all.
Huh? Was that a joke?
You seem know very well about your profession. But do you have courage to prove yourself?
I am ready!
Give me a minute...
Since Shamans love nature, I heard that in <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Holy Plain</FONT> there are a group of <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Blue Demon</FONT> are corrupting the landscape. What are you going to do about them? Please get 5 <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>their Confession Letters</FONT> to prove your power!
Young medium, come on! Prove yourself!
You don't seem know your profession well. You disappoint me!
Those who use sheer mental brilliance to gain Soul Power are Machinists. This is manifested in their amazing creations, from weaponry to the Hunter Stone. Machinists believe in facts. They believe that the Umbra are collection of weak souls and can be destroyed by powerful machines. They invented long distance weapons to avoid close quarters fights. Am I right, machinist?
Absolutely
What did you say?
Great! Do you have courage to prove yourself?
I am ready!
Give me a minute...
I hope to live a better life. I decide to lose weight! I heard in <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Holy Plain</FONT> there is a <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>twin mummy</FONT> whose <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>tough skin</FONT> can help you to lose weight! Can you bring <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>3 pieces</FONT> to me?
I don't think you can make it. And I am not fat!
I am so disappointed! You seem to know nothing about yourself!
These Umbra are getting more and more wild!
Reno basic conversation
In the town, a guy named <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Mr. Xiao</FONT>! He's been hysterical all day...
What's wrong?
It does nothing with me...
I heard that he is haunted by a Umbra. He loses control of himself and scares his own pregnant wife.
Really?
I'd better stay away!
Right! He often berates his wife because of the evil spirits! You should visit <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Mrs. Xiao</FONT>some time. She is so poor...
I am so disappointed!
You are so cruel!
I don't sleep well lately!
What can I do for you?
I have nothing to do with it!
It is all because of <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Dirt Umbra Kid</FONT> crying at midnight and touching my left foot to wake me! I want to teach them a lesson! Can you help me?
No problem!
Yes...try counting sheep!
Head to the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Holy Plain</FONT> and help me get rid of these pesky Umbra! <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Bring 3 bunches of their hair</FONT>, so that I can scare them away for good! That'll show them!
Counting sheep? I used to count till 10000!
Oh...ok...whatever...
Can you help me?
Yep. I'm on it!
Yea, no. Get your own hair.
Please help me to deliver this <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Mine Stone</FONT> to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Rolio</FONT>... Thank you so much!
He's a stone's throw away!
Uhh..it's too heavy for me!
Give this <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Mine Stone</FONT> to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Rolio</FONT>. Please take good care of it!
Ok, I am disappointed!
A stone? Heavy? Wow...I thought you trained!
I just took a nap and lost my <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Jade</FONT>!
Have you noticed anything?
Just buy a new one!
I was about to fall asleep and saw <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>something like an orange candy...or a so-called freezing team</FONT> approaching me. I slept eventually. But after I woke up I found that my <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Jade was gone</FONT>!
Let me find it for you!
Oh, it's no problem.
The thief must be that <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>something like an orange candy... or so called freezing team</FONT>. Please help me!
No! I will bring it back!
No way! This jade is like my wife! I even cuddle it at night...
Lately, the residents here formed an <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Umbra Bursting team</FONT>..or was it a Umbra busting team? I can't remember, all I know is they ain't afraid of no ghosts! I want to donate something to them. Can you help me?
Will be great if it's within my ability!
Just mail them a pear. A ripe one.
Umbra busters! They need courage and wisdom...they also need a good leader, since the last one never recovered from that giant marshmellow. So I want to give them <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>a crown</FONT> for <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>their leader</FONT>, however I lost the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Umbra busting diamond</FONT>. So I need your help. <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>The Umbra busting diamond</FONT> is made of <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Umbra</FONT> tear drops. You can only get them by killing the Umbra... Thank you, and good luck.
Bustin makes me feel good!
Whoa, Umbras? I'm out!
<FONT COLOR=#00ff00>The Umbra busting diamond</FONT> is made of <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Umbra</FONT> tear drops. You can only get them by killing Umbra... They have been seen in <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Plague Dungeon 1</FONT> ... Thank you so much!
Then you won't help me?
A Pear? Pears have nothing to do with Umbra hunting!
Iron smithing is such an enjoyable and interesting job!
Romeo basic conversation
A nice man...ya? Are you the nice man helping me to gather herbs last time?
Yeah, it's me alright!
Lalalala--can't hear you!
May I ask you for a favor again?
Yeah, of course!
Who are you?
I just picked up a bunch of flowers for my Juliet, but was robbed by <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Twin Mummies</FONT> from the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Holy Plain</FONT>! Please help me to get them back... It was a bouquet of <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>10</FONT>! Thank you so much...
I... am... Romeo...
How did I miss that?
I disappointed Juliet! My flowers made her allergic!
Then, what could be done next?!
LOL, girls want gems, not flowers.
I heard that if you pull off some of <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Pumpkin Freezing Team's</FONT> hair...I mean their 'Pumpkin' vines, they can cure<FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Flower Allergies</FONT>, I wonder if you can help me get <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>5 </FONT> <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Pumpkin Vines</FONT> ok?
Yeah, of course!
No. I am very busy!
Pumpkin Freezing Team usually appears at <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Saint Field</FONT>. Please help me get <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>5 pieces of</FONT> their <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Pumpkin Vines</FONT> <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>and give them to Juliet</FONT> to cure her flower allergy... Thank you so much!
Ok...work on your own business, but when you have time don't forget to help me, ok?
This is a very serious condition! You must have some therapy!
I just heard that <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Blade Raccoon Dog</FONT> is planning to attack our village in 3 days! What should we do?
What's wrong?
My name's Joan and you're on your own!
Raccoon Dog has a habit. When their <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Silver Blade</FONT> becomes dull, they will attack a village. Human blood helps sharpen their blades, you see. The Blade Raccoon Dogs love their blades more than their lives. If you take one of their blades, the rest will run away...
Then, what can I do for you?
I gotta go if you don't need me
We should take their blades and scare them first! If... you can help us get <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>5 of</FONT> <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Blade Raccoon Dog's</FONT> <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Silver Blades</FONT>, we will hang the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Blade</FONT> in front of our village. If they see them, <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>they will run away</FONT>, and be gone forever!
Ok! I will help you guys!
I'd rather have a rest!
Blade Raccoon Dogs are around <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Holy Grace Church 1F</FONT>. Please help us get <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>5 of</FONT> <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Blade Raccoon Dog's</FONT> <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Silver Blade</FONT> . We will hang the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Blade</FONT> in front of our village. If they see them<FONT COLOR=#00ff00>they will run away</FONT>...
I am so disappointed! How can rest be more important than the lives in the village? Juliet lives there too!
... I thought you would be happy to help us... Never thought you would run away! I am so disappointed!
... I really hoped I could give you some useful help...
Brave soul... I am glad to see you! You always help me when I am in trouble. Thank you so much!
Do you need any help?
You're welcome, bye bye!
Since you know me so well, I will just be frank with you...
Yeah, of course!
Why do I have to help you?
I was moved when Juliet gave me the garment she made. I think I will give her a gift for her to remember me...
What can I do for you?
Why do I have to help you?
I want to make a 'Deep Sea Star' necklace for her. But, er, I don't have a 'Deep Sea Star'. <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Deep Sea Star is made of Water Spider's tear drops</FONT>. Can you please help me get <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>one</FONT> <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Deep sea star</FONT>? Water Spiders are around <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Holy Grace Church 1F</FONT>. Thank you so much!
Sorry... I did not intend to bother you... I am sorry!
Alright... You already said that... How could I ask you for more help...
Ah... Please... I need your help again... Don't leave...
My father gave me an impossible mission yesterday... I have no idea what to do!
What mission is it?
It does nothing with me...
All this was because of <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Demon Spiders</FONT>! My father was passing by <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Holy Grace Church 1F</FONT> once upon a time. Demon Spiders attacked him. My father's sword couldn't cut through their skin but was broken. My father passed the sword to me and hope me to fix it. But it is very difficult...
What's up again? I can help!
Oh, then, you keep working!
Thank you for helping me. The only way to stop them is to go to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Holy Grace Church 1F</FONT> , and find <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Demon Spider's</FONT> <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Spit</FONT>! You are the only one can help!
I think you still have something to do. No problem! I am willing to wait for you right here. Could you please help me when your stuff is done?
... I really hoped I could give you something to help you in your training...
Oh, poor Juliet... Poor Juliet!
Juliet basic conversation
Spring is the most lively season! But in <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Saint Field</FONT> , all the plants are sleeping... There must be something wrong...
What's wrong?
It does nothing with me...
It is all because of <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>evil wolfman</FONT>! It cursed the land with its blood! Only if we get its <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>hair</FONT>, and throw the powder that is made of the hair to the land. Then the plants will be saved!
Please let me contribute my help!
I gotta go if you don't need me
Thank you for willing to save this land. Please go to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Saint Field</FONT> and get <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>10 pieces of evil wolfman's hair</FONT> for me... Be careful!
... I really hoped I could give you something to help you in your training...
... I really hoped I could give you something to help you in your training...
There is a dangerous adventure ahead... Oh... My Romeo... I wish you can help me to complete this mission! I know that our love will give you power! But... I can't wait too long... I am dying...
What can I do for you?
Boy crazy! Don't waste my time...
Please go to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Holy Plain</FONT> to inform my <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Romeo</FONT>... to hurry up and come back soon... I am dying...
Oh... My Romeo...
I want to sew a coat for Romeo. Then, he could feel my warmth all the time.
Ya, this is great!
Eeh...stop it!
I want to make a perfect garment by weaving 'Water Spider's' Water Silk! But Water Spiders guard their silk with their lives. So <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>you'll have to defeat Water Spiders first</FONT>! Are you willing to help me with this difficult task?
I'd love to do that!
I have something to do!
Please go to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Holy Grace Church 1F</FONT> to get <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>3 pieces of</FONT> <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Water Spider's</FONT> <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Water Silk</FONT>. Thank you so much!
Alright... I am right here waiting for you! Don't forget me when you are done!
Love is timeless! If you do want to set a time limit for love...then, it should be a million years!
Hey! Thank you for getting me Water Silk last time. So I could make this comfortable cloth! Just... I need another favor from you... I wonder...
No problem!
I am very busy!
Although the garment is completed, it would be better with some decorations. Can you go to the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Holy Plain</FONT> to find <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Romeo</FONT>, ask him about the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Flame Medal</FONT> and bring me one. Thank you!
Alright... Thank you anyways!
When can I stop being sad? Romeo...
Granny Min
I am so old that every inch of my body hurts!
What can I do for you?
It does nothing with me...
Could you please help me find a doctor named 'Brodosky' in 'Map D', whose medical bandages can cure those pains? Please get 2 pieces for me!
No problem!
Ah... I forgot... I need to take care of something else...
Remember his name is 'Brodosky' in 'Map D'. I'll be waiting!
Those young people...
... I really hoped I could give you some useful help...
Young one... Could you please send this meal to my grandson?
Alright!
Not a big deal missing a meal...
Please help me deliver the order to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Map E</FONT> to my grandson, <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Belchif</FONT> he is a blacksmith trainee... Thank you so much!
Says who! Kids need food to grow up!
Young man... Thank you for help me so many times, but I still need one more help from you, may I?
Yeah, of course!
Ah? What...sore!
I just realized that my grandson ask me to find his classmate <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Elena</FONT> to borrow a book named <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Spirit Control</FONT>. Can you find it for me?
Alright...
I want to cook meatloaf for my guests, but I don't have enough <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Meat</FONT>, can you go to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Saint Field</FONT> to get some meat for me?
Yeah, of course!
What did you say? Oh...Bye bye!
Yeah, find <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Blade Raccoon Dog in Saint Field</FONT>, its Raw meat is perfect for meatloaf... Please buy <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>5 dollars of Raw meat</FONT>back.
Never mind...
I am old... Everything will go back to dirt... I am not afraid. It is merely a journey that we must all take.
Jin Kun basic conversation
Can you help me? Juliet came to me yesterday and said that <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Romeo</FONT> is sick recently! I wonder if you can take my <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>air tube</FONT> to the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Holy Plain</FONT> to collect a sample of <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Romeo's</FONT> breath and bring it back to me?
Alright!
When I have time...
Thank you so much! please remember that the air tube can only stay pure for<FONT COLOR=#00ff00>5 mins</FONT>so you need to get back<FONT COLOR=#00ff00>in 5 mins</FONT>! Be careful!
Alright! I know you are busy...take care...
Being a doctor is so tough!
Something happened to you?
No way! You think too much!
Last night, there was a drunk... No, a <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>confused man</FONT>, but then I realized it was really a <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Bronze zombie</FONT> who came to me for a drink! Outrageous! But I am just a doctor and don't have liquor. Then he just took away my <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Whole bottle of lodine</FONT> and drank all of it! I can't work without lodine. can you please help me to get it back, even if you have to beat it out of him!
Sure. Although, I'll say one thing--this is by far, the weirdest task that anyone's asked of me yet. Seriously, a drunk zombie? What's next?
Next time, I will help you!
Believe me, you haven't seen anything yet. Moving on, the one who took my <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Iodine</FONT> lives in <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Fujin's Field</FONT>, and he's named <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Bronze Zombie</FONT>. Please help me get it back!
I just need a small favor... So disappointed!
Sigh... You don't know my situation...
Last night, I dreamed two <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>River Kids</FONT> crying and telling me that they just touched <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Blade Raccoon Dog's</FONT> but...it robbed their water hat. <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Without the Water hat, the River kids lose their magic</FONT>, and they might die!
So...?
I hate Umbra!
Please help me! Go to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Blade Raccoon Dog</FONT> and get the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Water hat</FONT>. It will teach the river kids a lesson!
Oh... Alright!
I am busy right now! Next time!
Please go to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Saint Field</FONT> and find <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Blade Raccoon Dog</FONT> and get <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>the Water hat</FONT> back!
Oh... Forget it then...
oh... Alright! I won't bother you anymore...
People say that men can turn into zombies if they are infected by zombies or if they are buried next to a zombie. There was a governor here whom the villagers hated and buried him without caution. He turned into a zombie later and revenged on the villagers by infecting people. The number of zombies are increasing quickly... What should we do?
How can I help you then?
I'd rather get away...
Zombies are afraid of sun light. Maybe we can use <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Mirror</FONT> to reflect sun light on them. I think it will work...
What can I do then?
Ask someone else!
<FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Mirror</FONT> can be found in <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Fujin's Field</FONT> where <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Demonic Mirror</FONT> lives... Please help me bring <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>5 pieces</FONT> back. I want to give them to the villagers to protect themselves...
Alright!
Never thought you are such a coward!
After halloween, Pumpkins were thrown away as trashes. They gathered later and decided to change their image. They learned after snowman and doubled as 4 pieces a group. They hope people could look at them differently.
This is great...
It's none of my business...
But there is a sense of hatred among those Pumpkins, which changed their original intention. They are now rebellions!
What can I do then?
Forget it! You never knew it!
Rebellious <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Pumpkin Totem</FONT> ate <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Satanic crystal</FONT>! And <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Satanic crystal</FONT> generate poison in their body that cause Pumpkins lose their mind and start to rebel, revenge and do something bad... So, please bring me <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>five</FONT> <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Satanic crystal</FONT> for experiment. If you can give me a period of time, I think I can produce the potion to solve the problem. Please bring them back to me...
No! This is not my style! Protecting the natural environment is my duty!
You can't just take the face value! Sigh... I will talk to you later when I have time!
You have to learn how to love yourself before you want to love someone else! How can you love someone when you don't even love yourself?
Elena basic conversation
My mom once told me a very touching true story. I really hope one day I could change the situation to help the poor kid to get back his lost memory...
I can help you with that!
Sigh... So much trouble
My mom told me once that there was a big fire in the village 50 years ago. A young mother with a twins sacrificed herself to save her children even though they were badly burned. And even worse, the evil wolf found them, <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>it ate their memory crystal</FONT> and escaped. The twins grew up without knowing their mother. They are very good brothers but hate the world...
What can I do then?
It's just a memory lost!
You are such a kind man! I wonder if you can get <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>The memory crystal</FONT> back to the twins. It is such a wonderful thing to do!
I'll take care of this!
I don't do small business!
Thank you so much! Please remember that <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>The memory crystal </FONT> is taken by the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Evil Wolf</FONT>! The Evil Wolf usually appears in <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Saint Field</FONT>... Thank you so much!
You have no heart! You are not a nice person!
You are so cold-hearted! I disgust you!
Soft-hearted is better than cold-hearted!
Annoying! Annoying! Annoying!!
Annoying? What is it?
Annoying? I am leaving then...
When I was sleeping last night, I felt something touch my face... Then I woke up in the morning and found that my book is gone! I probably know who stole my book. Can you help me get it back?
Sure
Next time, I will help you!
It must be the guy who lives in <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Fujin's Field</FONT> and is named <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Crazy paperman</FONT> ! They like to disguise them by bookmarks and steal books... Name of my book is <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Religion summary</FONT>. Please help me get it back!
I just need a small favor... So disappointed!
I am not annoyed by you! Please don't go...
I am so unlucky lately!
What's wrong?
Anger makes people getting old! Ha ha ha!
It is all because of <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Stone Gargoyles</FONT> who live in <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Saint Field</FONT>... They can turn into <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Stone</FONT>... Even though they can't attack me in that form, I am very annoyed by them! I am often tripped by the stones. I hope to get rid of them! However, they are fearsome killers and follow the PenUmbra known as Soul Eater... They are very tough to deal with!
I wanna take a look!
Er...I gotta go now!
Great! Let me see...1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6... I have 7 bruises, so please kill 7 <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Saint Field</FONT> 's <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Stone Gargoyle</FONT>! They must pay!
Alright! I will leave you alone...
You are teasing me... I won't talk to you anymore!
Have you ever seen what a <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Blade Raccoon Dog</FONT> looks like?
You've never seen it before?
Who cares! I'm outta here!
<FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Blade Raccoon Dog</FONT>, they have blade paws and fly faster than wind! I have never seen their faces!
Do you want to see one?
I am busy right now! Later!
It is not that hard. Blade Raccoon Dog usually appears in <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Saint Field</FONT>. If you can <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>get BS stone from their bodies,</FONT> you can take a close look at them!
Alright!
Oh... Fine... I take back my question...
Have you ever heard that if you are bitten by an <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Evil wolf</FONT>, you will turn into it in full moon night?!
How does it look like?
It's none of my business...
They often appear in <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Saint Field</FONT>. They walk straight, have strong arms, sharp nails for attacking and the sometimes roar. They can easily jump away when they find their enemy is stronger.
Cowards!
I am not interested!
I am afraid of them... I wonder if you can help me...
No problem!
No! Ask someone else!
I heard that you could burn Evil wolf's palm hair and wear the ashes... Evil wolf won't come close to you. I wonder if you can go to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Saint Field</FONT> to pull <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>3 bunches of its hair</FONT>. I want to protect my mom and dad...
I don't know whom to go if you don't want to help.
It's ok...I am really scared...
Don't be so cold... It is not good!
I don't wanna go to school! NO!
Are you dreaming? Wake up!
Don't want to? Then, don't!
What do you want?
You didn't sleep well?
You slept like a pig...
Last night, those 4 in 1 Pumpkins were fighting for who's on top again. No one can sleep... I want to teach them a lesson!
Let me help you!
Go to bed earlier...
Do you really want to help me? The bunch of Pumpkins are called <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Pumpkin Freezing Team</FONT>! I saw them going to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Holy Plain</FONT>. Please help me <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>kill 10 groups of them</FONT>... And tell them that we'll use them for pumpkin pie if they keep making noise!
I must have payback...one day!
Sorry... I am really sleepy... I want to sleep...
Umbra Pumpkins... are...so annoying!
Mom said that I am the cutest... I want to be the cutest!
Mrs. Nina's conversation
People say that Snow woman was betrayed by a mountain god. Her grudge turned into thousands of <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Umbra</FONT>. Those Umbra look weak but are actually powerful! Their lives are all about revenge...
What should we do?
This is not my business...
Those Umbra that were created by Snow woman may look weak but are cruel as hell! They can freeze everything they see including humans!
Let me save the people!
oh...I gotta go now!
Thank you so much! Please kill <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>10</FONT> <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Umbra</FONT>! I hope they will be gone one day!
No problem!
Ask me when I have time
I heard that <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Umbra</FONT> are around <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Plague Dungeon1</FONT>! Please kill <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>10</FONT> of them!
Great. Please recruit more brave people to join us to kill Umbra...
I know you will be afraid too... Hopeless...
You are part of the world too... How can you be so ignorant? I am so disappointed.
I understand them as a woman... It is helpless... Killed by her lover... Only hatred left...
What should I do to help?
So terrifying!
Umbra come from the left memories, the memories that turned into <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>pieces</FONT>. They can't move one before forgetting them.
What should I do to help?
I am busy right now! Later!
I heard that if they bring <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>The memory fragments</FONT> back and pray on them, the Umbra would live in peace.
I want to help!
I'd rather give up
Please go to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Plague Dungeon</FONT> to get 6 pieces of <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Umbra's</FONT> <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Memory fragments</FONT> to me, and I will find the solution...
You also need a kind heart besides courage!
I knew you would say this! I am so disappointed!
Never thought you are such a coward!
Do you still remember the story about <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Snow woman</FONT> and <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Umbra</FONT>? Snow lady was betrayed by mountain god. Her grudge turns into thousands of Umbra. Those Umbra look weak but are actually powerful! Their lives are all about revenge...
Yeah... I remember this!
Don't remind me with bad memory
Thank you for cure the grudge of the Umbra... But there are still some <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Umbra turning into</FONT> <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Evil spirit</FONT>, whose grudge is much complicated than Umbra! The villagers all hope that you could help us again...
Good! Of course! I will!
I am busy...have to go!
Thank you! We have a plan for you which is fire! Just the fire is special...
No problem!
Ask me when I have time
It is from <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Plague Dungeon1</FONT> . There is a <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Dragon lamp</FONT> whose wick contains <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Original fire element</FONT>. You need to get <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>5 pieces of</FONT> <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Original fire element</FONT> back to me... Thank you so much!
Great! We will be waiting...
It seems that we expected too much from you... Sorry...
I don't know that your are still being haunted by the Umbra! Sorry...
Babies who live in poor condition are sad! Their parents often let them live on their own in the wild.
What about the kids?
I have nothing to do with it!
The babies that live in the wild are either starved or eaten or burned to death!
Where does the fire come from?
Don't lie to me! This is not true!
I believe that the unknown fire in the wild should be <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Umbra fire</FONT>. Umbra fire sometimes burns the land and those poor babies. The dead babies then turn into <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Dragon lamp</FONT> and are waiting for revenges...
What can we do?
I'd rather forget it!
Those <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Dragon lamp</FONT> are still young, so if you can destroy the grudge, they will be set free!
Then, what should I do to help them?
oh...I gotta go!
Thank you for your help! You need to go to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Plague Dungeon</FONT> and get 10 pieces of <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Dragon lamp</FONT>, and cure them. Everything will be fine then!
Why are you so cold? It's heartbreaking...
You also need kind heart besides courage!
This is real! I swear...
Never thought you are such a coward!
Where is my Magic dictionary? Have you seen it?
Do you need my help to find it?
I feel dizzy whenever I see a book!
The book contains the love letters that Rogosk wrote to me. A Paper kid sneaked in last night and took the book away! Can you help me find it? I can give him the book but the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>6</FONT> <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>love letters</FONT>. Can you help me get them back?
Yeah, of course!
Don't bother me! I am busy...
I heard that the Paper kid is <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Fujin's Field's</FONT> <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Crazy paperman's</FONT> body double. And those Crazy papermen like exchange their collections. So my love letters are probably in different places! Please help me get <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>6</FONT> <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>love letters</FONT> back... Thank you so much!
Oh... Fine... I have to find someone else to help, sorry!
Well... If you don't want to help... Just say it!
Umbra and demons are everywhere now! I don't know when is the end.
Henry basic conversation
I am pissed off! Do you know that <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Common people could gain wolf's power by wearing wolf's skin</FONT>?
Yeah...I heard that!
I don't care!
Women in the village told me that there are <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>3</FONT> <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Evil wolfman</FONT> around and attacks women. I believe that they are human with wolf skins! <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>They are sex predators</FONT>. Can you please help me?
What should I do?
Sorry, I am busy!
You are good man! But it is hard to tell fake wolves from real ones. Only if after they die, they will leave <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Dead wolf skin</FONT>... However, they are all bad!
I see! Then what?
I don't do small business!
Please go to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Saint Field</FONT> to find <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Evil wolfman</FONT> and kill them until you find 3 sex predators and get <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>3</FONT> of their <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Dead wolf skins</FONT> to comfort the women...
You have no heart! You are not a nice person!
Sigh...young people now are cold...
fine...forget it...
it's another sad story...
What is it?
I'd better stop talking...
Last night, a Umbra with wounds all over his body came to my house and told me a 300 years old story... A group of Stone Gargoyles attacked the village in a stormy night. They killed everyone including women and kids by <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Paper cut</FONT> whose spirits are still around till now.
What's Paper cut?
Is it edible?
<FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Paper cut</FONT> is cutting the victims bit by bit until they die. The Umbra and demons enjoy the game!
I want revenge!
I should stay away!
Great! In order to save them, you need <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>5 pieces of</FONT> <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Stone Gargoyles'</FONT> <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Powder</FONT> ! Thank you very much!
I am so disappointed!

Please don't leave...
Recently the poor kids are back! Such annoying!
What kids?
Rebellion? Put it down!!
A lot of kids died during the plague. Their poor parents have to put their bodies in the old castle where the vampires live. They turned the kids into vampires and call them <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Drapper</FONT>!
How can we stop them?
oh...I gotta go now!
If we could <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>get their Big Candy</FONT>maybe we can find a way to turn them back... Whatever, we need your help!
What should I do?
Ask me when I have time
Please get <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>3</FONT> pieces of <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Snail Big Candy</FONT> from <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Drapper</FONT> who live in <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Holy grace church</FONT> ! Remember it has to be Snail Lollipop!
Alright! I will leave you alone...
Alright! I will leave you alone...
They are dead already...what could we do?
It is time for spiders to reproduce...
Spiders? Reproduce?
Not my business...
Spiders are not so bad! But they produce hundreds of Earth Spiders who destroy everything! People are afraid of them!
Really? I want to take a look!
oh...I gotta go now!
<FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Earth Spiders</FONT>... are around <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Holy Grace Church 1F</FONT> if you can please get<FONT COLOR=#00ff00>5</FONT> <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Earth Spider's Fang</FONT> to me and I will ask brave men in the village to form a <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Anti-spider Army</FONT> !
No problem!
Ask me when I have time
<FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Earth Spiders</FONT> are around <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Holy Grace Church 1F</FONT>. Can you please get <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>5</FONT> <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Earth Spider's Fang</FONT> for me?
Alright! I will leave you alone...
Ok! If you are afraid, forget it...
I am very disappointed to see you don't care...
Can you do me a small favor?
No problem!
I am not interested!
Yesterday, when I was at <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Saint Field</FONT> fighting Umbra, my Bronze sword was broken! A group of <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Stone Gargoyles</FONT> came from nowhere and ate <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>The Ancient Copper Coins</FONT> and then escaped...
How can I help you?
I am busy right now! Later!
I have got 5 pieces of <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Ancient Copper Coins</FONT>. There are still <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>6 more</FONT> at <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Saint Field</FONT> in <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Stone Gargoyle's</FONT> stomach... Please help me!
Alright!
Oh... Fine... I take back my question...
Sorry, I am sorry, everyone...
What happened?
I am busy right now...
Spider... The Anti-spider army failed... The spiders <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>got new look</FONT> and became much tougher...
What? They got backup?
oh...I gotta go now!
Yes, they are <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Demon Spiders</FONT>... They came to help Earth Spiders! They have got my Bosses Ring which represents my leadership! Sigh...
I am willing to help!
Ask me when I have time
Really? please go to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Holy grace church 1F</FONT> to find <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Demon Spiders</FONT> and get my <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Bosses Ring</FONT>. Thank you so much!
Alright! I will leave you alone...
Ok! If you are afraid, forget it...
Sorry... Sorry! Sorry!
Umbra hunting is my holy duty. I must bust the Umbra! I must...
Thunder Hill Abdu
Best regards!
Hey, how are you doing? I have a job for you. Interested?
Listen carefully
Not interested
Great, I saved this job just for you. Here's the details: Dalifon wants to make some armor, and needs <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Mummy Bone</FONT>. He wants you to go to the Spiritual Land and get <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>5 Mummy Bones</FONT> from <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Flesh Wound Man</FONT>. How does that sound? They are tougher than those Little Mr. Leaf so I can't be held responsible if something bad happens.
Accept
Reject
Acting confident huh? You gave an answer right away; maybe you didn't even need to think about it. Alright, go to the Spiritual Land and defeat <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Flesh-Wound Man</FONT> and get <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>5 Mummy bones</FONT>.
I was counting on you... I thought you were braver.
Wow, you really seem to not like it. Alright, I'll do it myself. I was saving this job for you.
Hi, there's another job for you. Want to give it a try?
Why not!
Next time...
Great, now I can finally take a break. This was requested from Shuman. I'll explain it to you. I think you already know about the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Little Mr. Leaf</FONT> that appears in the fields near Thunder Hill? The <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Little Mr. Leaf</FONT> carries something used to make some products.<PF>Shuman asked me to get <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>5 Leaves of Treasure from Little Mr. Leaf</FONT> for him. I'll warn you though, unlike the previous job, this one is risky. What do you think?
Accept
Too dangerous
Alright, then can you go to the Spiritual Land and defeat a few <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Little Mr. Leaf</FONT> to obtain <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>5 Leaves of Treasure from Little Mr. Leaf</FONT>? Once you have five, come back to me.
Alright. I can't blame you. Life is a priority.
That's rude, I'll ask someone else.
Um... I do have a new job for you, but with your current ability I can't let you go.
We meet again. How are you doing? Interested in another job? We've worked together before, so this time your reward will be better.
Depends on my reward
With just that much...
Oh come on, it hurts my feelings when a friend is ungrateful. Anyway, this time its from Sonsi. He is uber busy right now and needs some help with a delivery. Can you help?
Accept
I don't want to smell sweaty
Alright take this package. Deliver it as soon as possible to Diba in the south side of the town.
Your inventory is full. Clean it up and come back.
Alright. I'll give this job to someone else.
How greedy.
I have another job for you, you want to do it?
Of course
I'm busy
Well then, let me explain the job to you.<PF>It's fairly simple. The Request Paper I had you take the other day had a request from the Union, so I want you to take this Union Church Member List to the soldiers to the Southeastern Prophet Council, then come back. That's it - easy, right?
That sounds easy
No way!
Alright, please hurry!
Your inventory is full. Clean it up and come back.
Alright, someone else will do it.
Alright, I'll find someone else.
Hey, can you do me a favor? I have a job that will pay well.
Tell me about it
No, thanks
It's not that bad. Oh, let me introduce myself first. I'm Abdu, I work as a broker. Get many jobs done quickly and obtain a brokerage fee. Usual jobs aren't too dangerous, so if you're interested let me know.<PF>Currently, I'm looking for someone to pick up paperwork from other places. I'm rather busy, and can't be everywhere at once. That's why I'm looking for someone to pick them up. Would you like to do this for me?
Accept
Reject
Ah, good! I want you to pick up some request form from Sonsi from magical goods store, Shuman from item store, guild master Chezla, and Dalifon of accessory store. Thanks. <PF>Oh, I forgot to tell you the location! The magical goods store is on the east side, the house with straw roof. The item store is on the west side with a straw roof. The guild office is a wooden house on the north east side. Lastly, the accessory store is on the south east side straw roof house. Please go quickly.
Oh? Seems like you didn't like this job.
Oh? Seems like you're too busy.
Thunder Hill Sonsi conversation
Oh, its you. If you find any magical goods you like, purchase them.
Oh, its you. There are other favors I want you to do, would you help me?
Sure
No, I'm busy
You've been to Spiritual Land right? People say that they've seen what we call <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Drowned Demon</FONT> near the south side. That monster is special and at rare times carries hard shell,  which is something we humans cannot get. I want you to defeat them and obtain <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>3 Hard shells</FONT>.
I thought I could rely on you, young one.
Oh great, you're strong and limber. Would you do me a favor? It may be simple, but I'll pay you well.
Here's the story. When I make magical goods, I use a special material called Heavens Bell Flower, but I'm out of stock. It can't be found in Thunder Hill.<PF>I've heard that <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Flame Lightning Spirits</FONT> eat this flower. I want you to go to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Spiritual Land</FONT> and  get <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Heavens Bell Flowers</FONT> from <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Flame Lightning Spirits</FONT>, can you do that?
Alright
No I can't
Alright, please go to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Spiritual Land</FONT> immediately and get <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>5 Heavens Bell Flowers</FONT> for me!
Do as you like!
Oh? Then I wont say anything more.
If you need magical goods, come take a look.
Thunder Hill Shuman conversation
Oh, thanks the other day.
Hello, you seem to have finished the job from the other day. I have a slightly dangerous job, do you want to take it?
Let me do it!
Um... I want to live
The materials needed to make potions are almost gone, at this rate we can't do business.<PF>I want you to collect <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Fairy Powder</FONT>. Fairy powder can be obtained from <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Fairies</FONT> but its pretty dangerous. What do you think, do you want to try it?
Leave it to me!
Not my job
Alrighty! Now go to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Spiritual Land</FONT> and defeat <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Fairies</FONT> and get <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>5 Fairy's Powders</FONT>.
Fine then. I'll ask someone else.
Hahaha... You're a funny young one! It's true you can't do anything without life.
Welcome! Want to take a look at our products? They're all good! Or... Did you hear we are in need of help?
Yes
Just looking
Our job is simple, although it may be dangerous. I've been watching you since you came here, I think you're OK. I want you to deliver a Parcel to Tomyman at Meteor Pit. Can you do that?
Alright
No I can't
Alright, take this Parcel to Tomyman in Meteor Pit.
Your inventory is full. Clean it up and come back!
That's too bad...
Enjoy choosing!
Welcome! Our products are all great and reasonable. Enjoy!
Thunder Hill Dalifon conversation
Wow, you're amazing!
....Hey, about that job you helped me with that other time, now the situation has changed. This time, it is pretty complicated.
What happened?
Sounds complicated
Remember the Demon Spider you defeated, they weren't individuals, there seems to be someone controlling them. They seem to be causing trouble to travelers again. I assume that there may be an even stronger monster nearby, it may be their boss.<PF>I want you to defeat it and report to me, can you do that? When you're done, I'll definitely reward you!
Sure
I can't handle that
Alright I'm counting on you! I believe they're at the south of <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Holy Plain</FONT>, where the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Demon Spiders</FONT> are. Search around there.
Darn! I guess everyone is afraid of unknown power. After all they are Umbra.
Yeah, that's why I'm thinking... Do you have any good idea?
Hello, there. From the last job I know I can really rely on you. How about another one? I won't disappoint you.
What do you want?
Next time?
Its an easy task. You know holy plain right? Its to the east of spiritual place, I get some of my supplies from there. These days, <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Demon Spider</FONT> seems to be causing trouble, my supply dealer is afraid and cannot deliver my supplies. Demon Spider appear near the south side of the river, can you defeat them?<PF>I think you can handle them. If you succeed, I'll reward you. What do you think?
Accept
No, Demon Spiders...
Alright, go east to the holy plains, and defeat the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Demon Spider</FONT>s! As evidence, bring <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>6 Demon Spider Fang</FONT> to me.
Darn! I guess I'll find someone else.
Grrr you! After being so nice to you, you give me that attitude. I was just trying to give you fame!
Hey! Leave me alone. If you want to buy something, talk to the other guy!  Sigh... What should I do....
Help him
Don't like his attitude
Hmmm, you're going to help me? I don't know if I can rely on you but if you say so. Here's the story. Its almost my wife's birthday. A little while ago, I purchased a ring as a gift in Meteor Pit.<pf>I went back to search the river near Spiritual Land, but couldn't find it. I think it was washed away to the river south of <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Holy Plain</FONT>. Can you possibly find it for me? Of course I'll reward you.
Leave it to me!
Too far
I'm in a rush, please! Go to the river south of <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Holy Plain</FONT> and find <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>ring case</FONT> for me!
What an unreliable person!
You really can't do anything about it?
Be quiet! If you want to purchase something, talk to the clerk.
Thunder Hill Chezla conversation
Hi! Do you want to search a guild or establish one?
Search guild
Establish guild
Feel free to look around
You are already in another guild! You must be over level 25, and not currently in any guild to establish one.
You are able to establish a guild. When doing so, you need <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>500 gold, 1000 SP, and an unused guild name</FONT>. Do you have that ready?
Yes I do
Let me think for a bit
Tell me the guild name you wish to apply to.
Alright, think well. Come back when you're ready.
You are under level 25. You must be over level 25, and not currently in any guild to establish one.

I want my son to get to get hold of himself.
Ah, good to see you again, young one.
How do you feel?
Hello
I'm fine! My legs still work, though not like they used to... Yeah, just as you say. I'm worried if Dugga is doing well over there. Oh, he might need some food, could you take this to him? And please check on his condition as well.
Not a problem
I don't feel like it
Alright then, take this pack of food to Dugga in Spiritual Land.
Your inventory is full. I wanted you to take food to him, would it be possible to make room for it?
Alright, I'll ask someone else
You're a very nice person.
Oh... son, where are you?
Something wrong?
I don't see anyone...
Young one, my son Dugga loves history and antiques. He didn't know where to start with his research at seal tower.< BR>He said he was going to search around the giant tower and never came back.<PF>If I were a little younger and healthier I would go myself to see, I even have weapons ready! Young one, you seem kind. Can you go look for him?
Leave it to me!
Not interested
Great, I knew it! When you find my son, I need to really thank you.
You're no help at all. Fine, I won't ask for your help!
Dugga...... where are you?
Dugga...... where are you?
Spiritual Land Dugga conversation
Did you come to see the giant tower?
Hey it's you again! How can I help you this time?
Sightseeing
Just walking by
I see. Well, there's been no progress for me, unfortunately.<PF>Oh, if I had my old book it would help. My father should know where it is. It's a book called Record of the Giant Tower, can you bring that to me?
Sure
Next time
Alright then. Please get the book from my father Diba at Thunder Hill.
Alright, I guess I'll continue searching without it.
You're really busy huh.
What do you want?
Meteor Pit Tomyman conversation
Its been a while, how are you doing?
Hello. You were so great the other time. Can you help me again?
Of course
No
That's great. Can you go to Spiritual Land south from here? There is a giant tower in the center. To the west of that, there is a plant called a Cocoon Herb. Cocoon Herbs are used to make potions and I want you to get me one. It's not something I need a whole bunch of, but are required to make potions.
Oh really? I guess you're busy then.
Its been a while, how are you doing?
What should I do, my son went somewhere again...
Need help?
Go and look for him!
Thank you so much! I can't leave the store so I need your help. My son is gone but I think he is within Meteor Pit. His name is Konelly, please go look for him.
You're right, I need to go immediately. But I can't leave my store open, what should I do...
Hello, how can I help you?
Looking for a job
Just looking
Oh really? I just finished making new potion, and I wanted to send a few bills to Meteor Pit but can you help me? Of course, I'll pay you.
Sure
No
Alright, can you deliver these to Blacksmith Drasky, accessory merchant Yuifon,  and weapon merchant Marthon?
Your inventory is full. Please clean it up and come back!
Is that so? I guess this job isn't attractive.
Is that so? New potions are pretty good, take a look at them.
Our new potions are great! If you need them, I'll sell them.
Meteor Pit Marthon
You have good luck, do you want something?
What's going on, looking for a job?
Sorry I'm poor!
I'm not a lucky man
Wow, how can you say such a thing. Alright, I'll give you a job. Recently, someone went through the north east of Spiritual Land and saw a shining stone. When they got closer, they were surrounded by The Four Pumpkin Brothers. It seems like they all have the stone with them... Interested? Can you get the stones for me? Please say yes.
Yes
Too lazy
Alright, I'll be waiting for you. Defeat the Four Pumpkin Brothers and look for the stones. I hope luck will be on your side again.
Of course. I didn't think that you'll count on luck again.
Hahaha... You don't want to listen to me? Damn you! People these days!
Who are you? What do you want?
Do you have a job?
I came to shop
Oh, looking for a job? Why didn't you tell me earlier! I do have a job but it may be too hard for you.<PF>You know Spiritual Land right? There's a monster called <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Shockey</FONT> there and I want you to defeat it for <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Broken Swords</FONT> . Those Broken Swords are used to make new weapons! When making new weapons, those are required!<PF>They are a powerful monster but do you want to give it a try?
I'm not scared!
Not doing this job
If you're not scared bring back <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>4 Broken Swords</FONT>!
Scared? Pretty sad. Alright, I'll find someone else.
You're in the way, if you want to shop, talk to the guy over there.
Who are you? I don't have time to spend on you!

Meteor Pit Arron conversation
Last time with your help,  we were able to get back our holy land of Meteor Pit. Thank you so much.
Oh its you, thank you for defeating the Umbra the other time.<PF>The spiritual force around the stone pillar ddisappeared when the Umbra were defeated, but how could I have expected such a thing...
Something else wrong?
I can't do anything
I think so. The reason why is that there are similar pillars in the south of <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Wastelands</FONT>. That <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>southern Wastelands</FONT> is covered with Umbra around it, it seems like the two pillar groups are having effect on each other. Either way, the northern Wastelands aren't fully purified yet.<PF>I guess the two stone pillar groups need to purified together. Need to work on it again from scratch......
I'll help out!
Good luck
You're going to help me again? That's amazing! Then can you check out <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>stone pillar group</FONT> of <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>south area of Wastelands</FONT>. There should be Umbra around it.
Thank you. I'll need to look for help.
Oh... alright. You've already helped me once so I can't ask you many times.
Oh young one. You seem to have just arrived to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Meteor Pit</FONT>. You don't know much about this place do you?
How did you know?
I know it well
Well, I didn't live long for nothing.    Meteor Pit was created by combining <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Machinist Society</FONT> and <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Warrior Society</FONT> together. That's why you'll see machine like buildings, or the symbol of Warrior Society, statues everywhere. Oh, you're not familiar with the western lands <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Wastelands</FONT> are you?<PF>The Wastelands at that place is said to have some kind of spiritual force that makes people feel good. That's why when people are depressed, they go there. It's people's holy land.  But...
But what?
Going to see the statue
But... recently I hear bad rumors. I heard that the spiritual force around the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Stone Pillars</FONT> are being polluted. It's thought to be the Umbra surrounding it that's causing it.<PF>Yes, definitely!<PF>It may be too sudden but just by looking at you, I can tell that you're a pretty skilled young one. Could you please help me purify the spiritual force and get back our holy land?
Sure, count on me!
Not worth it
Go west of Spiritual Land to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>north side of Wastelands</FONT>. There are <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Stone Pillars</FONT> placed in a circle, to the center of that there is a special stone pillar that is what I was talking about earlier. If you can defeat the Umbra around it, I think the spiritual force will be purified.
Alright. No matter what we say, you are an outsider, you wont understand how we feel.
Oh... Okay, sorry for bothering you.
I think I was misunderstanding.
Oh... Do you believe in something? The job we respect most at Warrior Society are <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Knight</FONT> and <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Demon Slayer</FONT>. You seem young so you still have a chance. I hope you will become a great one some day.
Thunder Hill Von conversation
Oh its you, how was the food last time?
Was like garbage!
It was delicious
How can you say such a thing...
Good. I was thinking of recommending that food!
Oh... I'm sorry. I still can't make that to dish taste great.
Something wrong again?
I want to try it
Well... I didn't realize till later but to complete that dish, I need a strong heat. I tried many things but still not close to completion.
Oh, there is one more way. But with my ability, its impossible. However, you may be able to do it.
What is it?
Waste of time
Um......near the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>west side of Wastelands</FONT> there's a monster called <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Locked Little Ms. Hanako</FONT>, they sometimes drop an amulet called<FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Wild Blaze Amulet</FONT>. that amulet creates high temperature flame. With that, I think I can do it.
Too far...
I'll help out!
Alright. You may have missed a wonderful dish.
Great, I think I can complete the dish!
Can't help it then...
Strange, I need more heat, more powerful one...
Darn, waiting and waiting but the ingredients from the west doesn't arrive. I cannot complete my dish like this!
Should I go take a look?
What happened?
That helps, the dealer said the road <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>westside of Wastelands</FONT> have enormous amount of Umbra causing trouble. Maybe defeating them will help get my ingredients here.
The dish I promised to present to you, seems like it will take a while. The ingredients I'm waiting for is not coming. Something has to be wrong.
Unfortunately the ingredients needed to make the dish has not arrived yet. Can you wait a little longer.
Wahaha, I've thought of a nice dish!
Are you a cook?
Can I taste?
Arr... do I not look like one? That hurts my feeling, I didn't think I wasn't looking like a cook.
Its true, come on have a taste. Oh, but I can't let you taste for free. The dish I just thought of cannot be made with ordinary ingredients. If you can get them for me, I'll treat you.
I'll go then
Never mind
You'll do it? OK. What I want is something called Narcissus Herb, adding this will change the taste dramatically! Most of <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Narcissus Herb</FONT> is found on the western land <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Wastelands</FONT>. Good luck.
Wow wow, are you just going to ignore the best dish in the world. This dish is definitely better than what the pope of Warrior Society eats everyday.
Hmmm... I wonder what kind of dish suits the title of Best dish?

How is Richard's situation?
Oh......<PF>No! The bird flew away. You made it fly away, what are you going to do?
I don't care!
What can I do?
How dare you little... Ignore what a priest says.
Umm... Let me think for a bit.<PF>Oh, since you made my bird fly away, can you deliver a message for me.<PF>This is a very important letter, deliver it as soon as possible. Otherwise... Since you caused this to happen I'm expecting you to take responsibility.
Alright...
Who cares!
Great, that's how you should be. Now deliver this message to aired security squad leader <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Richard</FONT> who is at the western area of <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Aird Field</FONT>.
Your inventory is full. Clean it up.
Oh my, what a little...
I heard that Fujin's Field is not in a good situation.
Fujin's Field Richard conversation
Meteor Pit Celine conversation
Oh its you, this place isn't very safe these days, you better be careful.
That's not good!
What happened?
I'll stay away...
Well, we've finally figured out why Drapper gathered in one place. The reason was that an even stronger monster was controlling them, but now they form groups and cause trouble. That's just not good...
Let me take care of them!
Let's run!
Oh? That's a great idea. You're a hero! Exactly as you say. But remember, that monster isn't going to be as easy as Drapper. Be careful...
Wow wow... If something happens, you just run away?
Why do you say such a thing? You have to protect the country! This problem can effect the whole world, not just a single country.
Oh, you? I've recently sent a group to investigate I didn't expect that the powerful vampires had even more powerful race within them. We call them <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Drapper</FONT>.
That powerful?
And?
Not just powerful! Attack, defense, HP everything is at a much higher level.
I want you to use guerrilla warfare on <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Drapper</FONT> to lower their numbers. We would like to assist you as soon as possible to defeat them but for now, you are our hope. This may not even be an advice but you may want to team up with someone else. They are different from normal vampires.
Oh its you, this place isn't very safe these days, you better be careful.
I think I've seen you somewhere...... Oh, I remember. These days I hear rumors about traveler that's been helping out people. From the information I hear, it is you, am I right?
Yes
Wrong person...
Just as I thought. Hmmm...... (watching from top to bottom). Traveler, being able to go through Wastelands without any damage,  you must be very skillful aren't you?
What about it?
You want me to join?
Aired security, no, Warrior Society may be in need of your help.
No, its not that. If you wanted to join the security squad, you'll need to pass an exam anyway. However, we are in need of some help so with your skill, you may qualify. This is not only for the sake of the squad, but for the sake of Warrior Society, to save the world.
How can I help?
Save the world? How old!
There's many things you can do! Recently, a bunch of slimes started gathering in one place, they seem to have some kind of plan... We security squads need to send people so that the Slimes don't come within Wastelands area. But we are in short of people, so we don't have enough force for the investigation group. I want you to do the investigation, can you?
OK, no problem!
Slime...yuck!
Alright, I knew it. Go to Fujin's Field and look deep. You'll probably run into <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Poisonous Slime</FONT> so defeat them.
Haha, if you don't want to that's fine.
Really? Young people these days...
Of course not. Or did I get old?
Strange, its getting even worse...
Fujin's Field Inias conversation
Thanks last time, I appreciate it!
Darn Fujin's Field! Since I was sent here as a guard, there's nothing good. Trouble and trouble!
Something wrong again?
That's too bad
It's a long story, I recently went to defeat some Umbra in the west with the other members. But I dropped something very important, what should I do?
Must go look
Oh, come on...
I can't, I'm not suited for fighting, I specialize in medical treatment and assisting others. That's why without the other members, I can't handle <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Mummy Mage</FONT>.
Does that mean, you're helping? Then can you please go <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>west</FONT> and defeat <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Mummy Mage</FONT> to get back my family heirloom.
Even you say that? Everyone says the same thing.
I don't understand why this place is called Fujin's Field. It's been quite a while since I came here but I've never seen birds.
I'm so useless. The things I was thinking of became reality...
How about solving the problem?
I want to know more
No no, with my ability, its impossible. But I have to repot to the top. It's all my fault, I didn't patrol that day, that lead to the spreading of the Umbra and I couldn't stop it.<PF>But you know, that <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Merrily</FONT> is insane. Its like a grudge and is really strong. A little member like me couldn't have done anything.
Need to go assist the others
No match for me!
That's right, I need to talk to the leader first.
Really?  Then if you can defeat <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Merily</FONT> at the west, I'll reward you. That way, you can make money and I don't have to get my leader mad.
From few days ago, this Fujin's Field is kind of strange. After the vampire incident, the monster's number is keep on increasing. Seems like different kind of Umbra are popping up as well.
Recently Fujin's Field is getting weird. Maybe something happened at <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Deep Lab</FONT> at north, or it could be <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Lost Cave</FONT> at south. If it is true, then we're in trouble! I hope it's not.
Darn statue gargoil......
Statue gargoil?
What happened?
Statue gargoil is a monster with hard body and sharp claw, faster than the wind and we are struggling on them.
Hmph......that statue gargoil again. My leg was scratched from the last patrol and I still can barely walk. I can't move far so I can only patrol close by. If I can just punch that statue gargoil, how would that be......
OK, no problem!
Good luck.
Really? If you can, please do so! They appear in the southern road right passed the bridge. At least that's where I met them.
Arr, until my legs are healed, I can't go for revenge.
Patrolling around here isn't interesting at all...
Increase scan fee
How dare you talk to me. What do you want? I'll tell you that if you go in the wrong direction, it's not my fault!
Level up
I want money
I want equipment
Your wish has been granted! ...... Cheater!
Your level is too high, you can't do that anymore.

Fujin's Field Kakukou conversation
I'm saved, thank you so much. Now Lost Cave will be back to normal.
Recently, this cave has problems only...
Ask what's wrong
Walk away
Young one, you're a very curious person. Alright, since you helped me twice, I'll tell you.<PF>Recently, a new monster called <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Vampirele</FONT> started to appear in the cave. I don't know if its because the spiritual force have changed, or was it summoned by someone. The important thing is, someone has to stop this situation. I already figured out that monster comes from <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Monster jar</FONT> within the cave. But unfortunately I can't break it, can you help me again?
Help
Deny
Great. We have to guard this place so we can't move. I need you to go to Thunder Hill to meet <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Oumou</FONT>, and request for <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Sealed Powder</FONT>. I believe you can find him at Wizard's cave.
I didn't expect you to be that cold at that age. I can't stop crying. Why... Why... Can you be such a person...
How rude...
Hope he cools down
Oh... I was... So, are you interested in the situation of the cave? Then I shall tell you.<PF>The spiritual force has been polluted and is affecting the seal process. That means there is a chance that he might run away. If we can get rid of the Umbra... Since this cave has lots of water and high purification power, it can definitely weaken the problem.
Go for it
Leave immediately
Then go to the cave and defeat <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Cave Water Imp</FONT>. You can find them near the water, maybe they are the ones polluting the water.
Really? You're pretty busy then.
Oh... Need to look a little longer.
*sigh*, I hear their scream again... It's been happening a lot recently - the situation seems bad. Did you hear it too? It's a long story, and I don't want to cause panic, so please don't tell anybody about this.<PF>Anyway, the Lost Cave was us Mage Spiritual's training ground. That was because the cave gathered a lot of Spiritual Energy. However, we Mage Spiritual got caught in an unexpected event, leaving us no choice but to use the power Spiritual Energy of the cave to seal the powerful monster into the depths of the cave. I was placed here to watch over that monster. Recently his howls have become more frequent, making me think the Spiritual Energy of the cave is diminishing, and perhaps it will no longer hold him in... Yes, that must be it... Perhaps this is his about to break the seal and revive. It could just be me though, and I guess it is essential that we look into it.
Help investigate
Don't bother
Oh that helps. The truth is I can't leave this place If I leave and if the Umbra run out, that will be a problem. Even if I were to get help from Thunder Hill, that will take time and something may happen.<PF>I've already placed pearls that <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Stone Cave Bat</FONT> like. If they eat my <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Memory Pearl</FONT>, you'll find out the situation of the cave.
Oh... You look depressed but don't worry. If something happens, I'll call for help.
Young one, you shouldn't enter this cave. You might die!
Thunder Hill Oumou conversation
With your help, Lost Cave was saved. You may not be a Mage but the Mage spiritual welcomes you.
With your help, Lost Cave was saved.
Wow, my fortune telling giving a vague result. In the near future, there will be a disaster in the far west lands. Which is something with high relevance to Mage spiritual. Could it be... Something happened at Lost Cave?
Go and ask him
Stay quiet
I don't know what to say, just that the Lost Cave guard <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Kakukou</FONT> may know something. If you're interested, why don't you go ask him?
Accept
Deny
Oh, that's great. Can you go to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Kakukou</FONT> at Fujin's Field, and tell him that some kind of disaster will occur. He should be at the entrance of Lost Cave.
That's too bad, I'll think of another way.
You don't believe in fortune telling, that's fine. Time will tell us the truth.
This is the Mages spiritual holy sanctuary. Usually outsiders aren't allowed here, but you are special.
Thank you for waiting! Just finished making seal powder. Now can you go for a run? I can make these kind of stuff but can't fight. I can't go through Fujin's Field.
Accept
Deny
Oh great, take this powder to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Kakukou</FONT> at <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Fujin's Field</FONT>. He should be in front of Lost Cave.
Yes... this isn't good.
This is the Mages spiritual cave. Inside there is a holy sanctuary, but if you're not a Mage, please don't go near it.
Spiritual Church BF1 Admoff conversation
I didn't expect that the cyborg at Deep Lab had a relationship with principal Mad. That artificial living organism had a flaw so it was thrown out. That's why it went out of control and attacked people, and took over..................
As a scientist, I need to seek the truth. Deep Lab contains principal's experiments that attack people. From that, it is said that Deep Lab was fallen, but there is no evidence. I am planning on investigating why Deep Lab has been abandoned , do you want to help me?
Interesting
Not interested
Right? Interesting right? Before we begin, we need to know more about the situation at Deep Lab. I want you to take this letter to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Catlina</FONT> who is guarding Deep Lab at <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Fujin's Field</FONT>. When she reads this letter, she should help you out.
Your inventory is full. You can't fit my letter.
Alright, so only scientists seek the truth.
As a scientist, you just have to want to know the truth.
Fujin's Field Catlina conversation
Now I finally found out the truth, but a little sad......
Whatever people say, after all this incident, we were able to know why Deep Lab was ruined.<PF>Now, can you go back and report to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Admoff</FONT>? He will definitely write a book on your adventure.
Alright
I don't want to meet him
Now go back to my brother <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Admoff</FONT> at meteor pit <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Spiritual Church</FONT>.
Alright, then I'll go to him myself.
I finally finished reading the lab report. According to the report, that mad principal created an artificial life. I think... It's like a cyborg or something, but weird! Does that mean genius and mad people are alike?
I guess
Is this helping?
Don't you think so? He didn't just create artificial life, he probably had some other plan. Whatever it is, we normal people wouldn't understand what a crazy guy is thinking.
Of course it's helping, we are getting closer to our goal aren't we? Maybe this artificial life... No, I should say cyborg. Could that have caused Deep Lab to be destroyed? Don't you want to know?
Yes
You're going off track
If you go to Deep Lab and find this cyborg, the problem may be solved.
How did it lead to that? Are you saying we did this for nothing?
I'm sorry, I'm not done reading the records.
Finally finished analyzing. It seems like the Umbra weren't originally living here, something brought them here.
Like what?
And then...?
I'm not sure. But I think this will lead to the next hint.
Alright, we should check the lab report. There might be information on why Umbra were brought. It may be the cyborg that lost control, or even a result from an unsuccessful experiment.<PF>Whatever it is, thinking here is no use. That's why I want you to look for the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>lab report</FONT>. I would like to go as well but I will be no help.
Still not done analyzing, it will take some more time.
Let's talk about what we should do next. Otherwise the Umbra will gather again.
Got it!
Wait a while
According to the records, Deep Lab has been abandoned after the cyborgs that principal made went out of control. In theory, it shouldn't affect the investigation.<PF>Deep Lab has been abandoned for a long time. We don't know when Umbra started to take over the school, and started living here For the first step, lets take a look at this monster. If it succeed, we can get some hint from the Umbra that pop out.
Don't make me wait so long.
Are you investigating about Deep Lab?
Are you investigating about Deep Lab?

Five elements conversation
I am too old and about to die... At least I've got my books with me.   Hey hey... Where was I...oh     You look new. What are you doing here?
What are you looking?
Can you teach me something?
Oh, I was reading 'history of spirits and land'. I tried to find a way to get the five elements out of <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Tower of Remains</FONT> and spread them to other places but...
Then, what is the result?
Why do you read such boring stuff?
Unfortunately, I, by myself, cannot disobey natural laws. Let it be.
Boring? I am crazy about horoscope! Everything could be predicted by horoscope!   But I was always wrong, maybe I am old...
Oh! You are still interested? I am so moved. Then, which part do you want to rehearse? The beginner's calendar or the influences of five elements?
The influences of Five Elements
The calendar
We are controlled by five elements, which are <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>gold</FONT>, <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>wood</FONT>, <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>water</FONT>, <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>fire</FONT>, and <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>earth</FONT>. Everything in the world has its own character.
Character?
Character sounds romantic, it actually means<FONT COLOR=#00ff00>weakness</FONT>.    Usually we can easily tell earth, water and fire. Do you know that gold and wood are in the thunder and wind?
Basically, the five elements are lined up according to their weakness:   gold -> wood -> earth -> water -> fire. If you can make your strategy according to this order you will be more successful.
Our calendar are divided into 8 months with 7 days each month. You will find it in the small map. You need to read a lot of books before understanding it. The books are in the library.
I won't waste your time.      The idea that the 8 month calendar was calculated by scientists however, is a myth.
I can share my study of the beginner's calendar and the five elements. There are a lot of unknown myths.
Sounds difficult
They look very interesting
It looks simple until you study it deeply.    What? You are bored? What do young people turn into now.

Go explore the unknown world! It's so nice you're helping me with this.
You are such a good assistant! Hahahahahaha...
Nah...
....oh...
Hi, you come again! I am bored right now!
Any progress?
How can I leave here?
Nah...therefore I am so bored.
Do you need something?
I've thought about that before, but it won't be exciting anymore.
Oh, I heard that advisors from two villages all have some troubles and difficulties. Would you ask around to see what it is?
You want to help them?
No. Just trying to give you some ideas. You have some reputation in the Beginner's Village. You shouldn't waste your talent only in this village.

No. I just felt that I've already spent so much time on that formula. In fact, it's proved that this one on the second page of my Note Paper works!
Your Notes are so thick!
Yeah. Only my formula is reaching 200 kinds, but the Soul Lab thinks they are too dangerous. They won't let me use them, so my thesis is not approved yet.
How dangerous are they?
Explosive Medicine, Poison, Fury Medicine, Berserker Medicine...etc.
......
Why frown, these types of medicine are very common.     Listen, <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Jillydug</FONT> the old man, <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Jidy</FONT>, and the sensitive <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Belkana</FONT> are in trouble, we should help.
How would you help them?
Just help me to check if they are ok. I don't want to bother them.     Jillydug and Belkana are in the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Trial Cave</FONT>. Jidy is too scared to go to, so he stays <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>outside</FONT> crying. You will need my medicine.
Alright, I'll go!
I don't want to waste my time
Then, I look forward to hearing from you. Remember, don't interfere. Just ask around what  happened, I am just curious.
I am not short of it.
I heard that <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Jillydug</FONT> the old man, <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Jidy</FONT>, and the sensitive <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Belkana</FONT> are in trouble! We should help.

You are here again. It seems like I've got a good assistant.
Don't flatter yourself.
What else can I do for you?
Whatever. Your visit told me you are still interested in this formula.
Then, I don't want to help you anymore
What should I do?
You're not? Bye.
Next, I will test some formula. If you don't wanna help, please leave.
It seems very interesting
I knew you'd like it!
However, when I am making the medicine, you need to get some <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Slime Jelly</FONT> for me, after you get enough <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Slime Jelly</FONT>, I will finish the medicine.
Next, I will test some formulas. If you don't wanna help, please leave.
I'm leaving. Bye!
What should I do?
OK. Then, this is it.
I like your attitude. when I am making the medicine, you need to get some <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Slime Jelly</FONT> for me. After you get enough <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Fruit Jello</FONT>, I will finish the medicine.
Let's start.
I am a graduate student in the Soul Lab. As a student in Science, it is logical for me to research new formulas.
Alright, alright, whatever
I don't have time
Great, I hope everyone should be like you!...     Hey! Hold on! I should tell you what to prepare first!
No time? I will ask for someone else then.
I can't believe it. This formula is not dangerous. Why didn't I pass the last exam?
You are not qualified to help me. You should gain more experience first.

You've finished the second job transfer! Work even harder in the future!
You've got some good experience, but your occupation is not fit for me. You should go explore your own society.
It seems it is not your time yet. Train harder! Success is on its way!
In your opinion, what is the ultimate philosophy of a samurai?
Loyalty first!
Become strong!
I am glad that you want to serve the pope. I believe that <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Saint Soldier</FONT>  is your perfect profession.
Saint Soldier it is!
Saint Soldier? Not for me.
<FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Saint Soldier</FONT>... has strong belief and is loyal to the pope forever! You can learn the most powerful magic in the world!
Correct. This is what I want.
I have to think it over.
To prove your loyalty to the Church, you should kill the guy who dishonored the Church.
Who is it?
I have to think it over.
Great! He lives in <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Map O</FONT>, named <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Merrily</FONT>! If you could <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>kill 3 of them</FONT>, <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Saint Soldier</FONT> will accept you...

If you are selfish and would try anything to be stronger! Then, I believe Demon Hunter is your best occupation.
I want to be it!
I don't want to be it!
<FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Demon Hunter</FONT>... is not serving the pope any more! They study black magic in order to increase their power to kill demons. They are walking edge between right and wrong!
Correct. This is what I want
I have to think it over.
Strength and ability is what demon hunters are looking for! They may even perform evil deeds to become stronger. Are you sure this is what you want?
Correct. This is what I want
I have to think it over.
Then, I believe in your determination! But you still have to show me your ability. If you could pass my test, then you could prove your ability! Do you have the courage to do so?
Of course. I do!

Wa! Never thought you're so strong! Come on! I wish you would strive more in your future!
You... don't seem to be suited for this occupation. You should look for your own society.
Don't rush... be patient and follow the steps to be successful! Come on!
In your opinion, what is the ultimate philosophy of chemist?
Follow the norm
Pursue advanced magic
If you are struck and only use mainstream magic, I think <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Taoist</FONT> is your perfect profession!
Yes! I want to be a Taoist!
I don't want to be a Taoist
<FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Taoists</FONT> are strong against black magic and they only use mainstream magic. They are quick learners and gain spirit quickly!
Correct. This is what I want

In order to prove yourself, go to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Map Q</FONT> and find <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Little Mr. Breeze</FONT>,  that has been disturbing the village all the time...

Demon Riders study black magic in cult, Umbra are not all bad to them. They won't kill them unless it is necessary...
This is what I want to be
I don't want to be it
<FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Demon Riders</FONT> study black magics in a cult. They know the secrets of using spirit to increase their power. They can kill or cure the demon with peaceful methods. They can also raise the 'Dog God' to work for them.

Basic Conversation with X'mas Ambassador - Ray
<FONT COLOR=#00ff00>X'mas</FONT> is an important day in the world of mortals to celebrate the birth of God. The Demonic Ghosts injected the evil souls into the holy <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>X'mas Snowmen</FONT> on Christmas Eve... These cursed X'mas Snowmen are in an Ice Cave. They call that chilly place the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Ice and Snow World</FONT>...  Being a Valiant, your heart and soul must maintain pure! I believe that you are one of us - that you won't let them ruin this Holy Day... Defeat them! Valiant... I'm sure you can do it!   (This quest requires X'mas Valiant to have the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Candy Box</FONT> !)
It's better not to compare...
Give it to me!
Perhaps you have some important business tend to, so I'd better not keep you long... But I still hope you can help me... Please keep in mind my presumptuous request... Valiant, I look forward to seeing you again...
That's wonderful! With your help I'm sure all problems will be solved!   I need make some preparations as your guide. Ready yourself as well...  We'll head for the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Ice and Snow World</FONT> once you're ready...
Basic Conversation with X'mas Ambassador - Santa's Helper
... I don't know what to do!   I used to enjoy my wonderful life in the vast, quiet ocean...   Everything has changed from the day before <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>X'mas</FONT> !   The beautiful ocean is gone! Now there are just layers of ice... ... Everything's changed...  The friendly seals I used to live with... Its as if they're haunted by evil spirits! They have been corrupted and lost control! Some seals that are still living in the ocean have become thieves. They have stolen the X'mas decorations that <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>X'mas Ambassador - Santa Claus</FONT> arranged so painstakingly: the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>X'mas Bell</FONT>, the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>X'mas Tape</FONT>, and the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>X'mas Socks</FONT> ! Santa Claus is so mad that he has offered <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>X'mas Tickets</FONT> as rewards and is <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>now calling for Valliants to get them all back</FONT>!   But this is not the biggest problem. The biggest problem is... Seals have left from this place... Their hearts have been invaded by a gang of <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Evil Snowmen</FONT> who claim to have come from the Underground World! Those seals lost their hearts and souls and followed the Evil Snowmen to a place called the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Ice and Snow World</FONT>... It requires an <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>X'mas ticket</FONT> in order to gain access to that place... And X'mas Tickets are the rewards Santa Claus offers...  What bothers me is... I cannot help the seals I used to live with, but I hope you can set free their souls for me. I think these good-natured animals are doing bad things only because they have lost control... Especially now during the holy X'mas... Valiant, please help us! Please...
You'd better find someone else!
Give it to me!
You must find it hard to hurt them. It's just how I feel... I told myself... They are no longer the good-natured seals... Setting free their souls is what's best for them... ... But I just can't do it! I can't do it~~Valiant, help me! Valiant...
Thank you! I'm sure the friendly seals will be grateful for that...  I'll begin with the preparations. Prepare yourself as well...  When you're ready, let's head to the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Ice and Snow World</FONT>...
To have access to the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Ice and Snow World</FONT> you must have an <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Xmas Ticket</FONT>... The Xmas Ticket is a reward Santa Claus offers...  Find any of the Xmas decorations Silly Seals stole from Santa Claus: the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Xmas Bell</FONT>, the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Xmas Tape</FONT>, the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Xmas Socks</FONT>, and you will get the reward from Santa Claus!   I will wait for you here... Until you get an Xmas Ticket... Then we will head to the Ice and Snow World!

Friendship is invaluable, and there is no regret going up to the Sword Mountain, or down to the Fire Sea for it.

Is your love for him higher than the sky and deeper than the sea?    Will you go up to the Sword Mountain and down to the Fire Sea for him?
I will... of course I will!
I'd rather stay alive...
Like me, you seem to be a person who lives for love. For the woman I love best... I would bring her anything... even the stars in the sky!  By the way, have you come to make <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>a heart-shaped white chocolate</FONT>?
Yes. Sorry to trouble you...

Conversation with Wanrenmiji
I fear love, and yet at the same time I fear I won't find it. How many devoted women are there in the world? Simple acquaintance and close friendship aren't enough... I've begun to feel bored about my fate. But I don't want to love too freely... Do you have a lover? Do you love her just as I love my beautiful woman? If you prepare <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>5 Valentine Almonds, 10 Sugars and 20 Cacao Beans</FONT> and give them to me... I'll make you the perfect <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Heart Dark Chocolate</FONT>. Everyone loves me except for the bashful woman I love...! Is this a punishment from the gods for being too handsome?
I am ready.
Then...Let us prepare!
I don't want cavities...
I am one handsome devil with these beautiful eyes of mine. I have good manners, I'm tall and dashing, I shine like the sun. My, I am a man of striking appearance...!  Even the gods must envy me... is that why they make it so my love doesn't love me back?! Oh dear! Am I the man of legends, the one that even the gods envy...?
Yes... you're handsome!
You're kidding, right?
My handsome looks may stop the planets and move the gods themselves... but oh, not my woman... I would do anything for her... even disfigure my own face!  By the way, have you come to make a <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Heart Dark Chocolate</FONT>?
Yes. Sorry to trouble you...
Honestly... I love you

I would appreciate it if you could give me a hand... but... You have to promise me, don't tell anyone!  You can't hurt him either!    I need you to swear by Heaven!
I won't hurt him.
Please...Is it that serious?
Ok! I believe you! The thing is.. It was on an evening decades ago when I went through Saint Field on my way home... I heard a remote cry and I was curious so I got close, and then I saw  a <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>baby wrapped in an orange coat</FONT> curling up in a lonely corner, trembling and crying!  I was frightened and thought... Why is there a strange child here!?
And then?
The child was crying so sadly I took it to heart and asked him if he needed any help. Upon hearing my voice, he raised his head and looked at me with such innocent eyes. He didn't seem to understand what I was saying, but he wanted to tell me something. I couldn't understand his language unfortunately. Then in a flash, I noticed there were scars all over his body! No wonder he was trembling so much!
Then?
Finally, I took him home with me so I could heal his wounds. I kept trying to ask him about what happened, but... as expected, we made no progress in communication. Maybe it was fate. I adopted him and gave him the name <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Chestnut</FONT>! From that day on, I began to teach <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Chestnut</FONT> our language. I always hoped I would be able to learn about <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Chestnut</FONT>. The days passed, and one day he said something to me... very slowly...
What did he say?
Chestnut told me he was a little ogre that got separated from <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>his group</FONT>. He couldn't find his way home and accidentally stumbled upon some towns where humans were living in Saint Field. Unfortunately, the humans noticed him... which is why he was black and blue all over! In the end, I decided to protect him from being attacked by raising him <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>deep in the remote mountains</FONT>. And now... I want to ask you a favor. It's gotten cold lately<FONT COLOR=#00ff00>and I've made a coat for Chestnut</FONT>, but I injured my leg and I can't walk through the woods. Will you take <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>this coat</FONT> to Chestnut for me?
Of course!
He's an ogre?! No!
Thank you...!  Chestnut is very kind...Please do not hurt him!  <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>I have put Chestnut's coat in your backpack!</FONT>  Chestnut lives <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>in the deep mountains</FONT>, in the Northwest of Saint Field...Please hand it to him in person!  Please... do me this favor...
Thank you!  But your backpack has been fully packed!  <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Can you clear it out </FONT>  Or else I cannot put the coat into your bag...
It's true that we're different species... but he's kinder than anyone I know! He can't fight or even use black magic. I've misjudged you... but that doesn't matter... Please don't forget the promise you made.
Of course! Of course I'm serious... ! Are you kidding?! If you don't want to help me, just go. Besides, look at yourself. You don't seem very trustworthy. You'd better go!
Forget it! Forget it! You don't seem to be trustworthy..   Go about your own business!!
My lovely Chestnut is a very kind and considerate kid. So why isn't he... oh, alas! The gods play tricks on us!  Maybe this is a test from the gods...
Ow, my leg...! My leg hurts so much! I got injured in a fall!  Ah! I can't bear to talk about it!
Do you need me help?
Let it go!

Alright. Here, this is the treasure map I  restored, please keep it intact. This is the key to activate the Artifact. If you lose it, everything is over.
Here. This is it... but why is it just a mere scrap?!  The remaining pieces must be being held in the two Evil Spirit Areas guarded by my brother and sister! We can't see the complete picture as it is now... <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Come back again once you have collected the complete treasure map</FONT>...!
You must be the Valiant that the Giant Tower Investigators spoke of... Nice to meet you!  May I take the liberty of telling you a story?   A story about something that happened to me and my two siblings? May I?
Okay, I'm listening...
I have no time for this...
Here is a key.
It happened a year ago...!  A treasure map handed down by our ancestors was taken away by <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>three women</FONT> who called themselves then <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Imperial Guards of the Angry Princess</FONT>... They didn't stop with just the map... Step by step, they came closer to us... Then there was a rustle from the ground, as if the Phantom was giving a fearful alert...
What happened then?
Ugh... I really have no time...
That night... Our parents defended us from the powerful attack with their bodies... In a flash, crimson red blood seemed to be everywhere... Staring at the sea of blood... the Imperiald Guards of the Angry Princess went mad, became sick and insane!  One of them, who appeared to be the leader, picked up his blazing broadsword and shouted... He continued shouting as he swiftly slashed down with his broadsword... Those people! They are devils!! Unforgivable devils! They beheaded my father... playing with their work as if it was all some sort of game... finally leaving with with a look of satisfaction on their face... The air was filled with a thunderous laugther... I still can't get it out of my mind...
What happened then?
Okay... I really have to leave
After they left... my mother told us of the secret of the treasure map... With her last gasp, my mother said... the treasure map points out a place... that hides... an ultra-powerful <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Blood Stone</FONT> and the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Deflector Shield Spell</FONT> that shuttles through the two worlds!  They were hidden away because the magic power of the Blood Stone was too powerful!  Countless valiants who had tried to dig up the treasure... to kill the evil <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Angry Princess</FONT>... all ended up badly wounded or even killed by the power of the stone... The Angry Princess hurried in order to take the map because the magic power of the Bright Shadow Valiant is looming... It threatens them...
What happened then?
The year is the Magic Power Year of the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Bright Shadow Valiant</FONT>, where the Valiant will be further empowered... This year it's exceptionally easy for the Valiant to take the Blood Stone... It's just that... the treasure map is currently being kept by the devils... I think that they are aiming to destroy the map... They are unable to approach the powerful weapons... therefore destroying the treasure map is the best they can do... I feel confident that this is what they intend to do...!
So what do we do?
The magic power of the treasure map is much weaker than that of the Blood Stone... But time and effort is still needed in order to destroy the treasure map... Therefore... before we must get it back before it is destroyed and then follow the instruction found on the map in order to find the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Blood Stone</FONT> and the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Deflector Shield Spell</FONT>!  Kill the devils... I will avenge my parents!
So... do you need my help?
Sorry... I can't help.
That would be splendid if you could help me... My siblings and I have found the camp of the three Imperial Guards of the Angry Princess... <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>The three devils live deep inside three towers</FONT>... It's tough to tell exactly what's going on inside... but after days of observation... we have made a small but significant discovery... We have found that the powers of the three devils seem to differ... The one which is my sister <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Mijin, appears to be the weakest</FONT>... My brother <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Mirya is somewhat stronger</FONT>... <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>The devil who tortured my father to death lives in the tower that I will take you to; he is certainly the strongest one</FONT>...  I think... attacking them one by one is our best strategy...
I will avenge you

I cannot find any keys to the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Evil Spirit Area that I asked you for</FONT>... You don't have the key to open the deeper <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>(Amethyst)</FONT> Area.
You must be the Valiant that the Giant Tower Investigators spoke of... Nice to meet you!  May I take the liberty of telling you a story?   A story about something that happened to me and my two siblings? May I?
Okay, I'm listening...
I have no time for this...
It happened a year ago...!  A treasure map handed down by our ancestors was taken away by <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>three women</FONT> who called themselves then <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Imperial Guards of the Angry Princess</FONT>... They didn't stop with just the map... Step by step, they came closer to us... Then there was a rustle from the ground, as if the Phantom was giving a fearful alert...
What happened then?
Ugh... I really have no time...
That night... Our parents defended us from the powerful attack with their bodies... In a flash, crimson red blood seemed to be everywhere... Staring at the sea of blood... the Imperiald Guards of the Angry Princess went mad, became sick and insane!  One of them, who appeared to be the leader, picked up his blazing broadsword and shouted... He continued shouting as he swiftly slashed down with his broadsword... Those people! They are devils!! Unforgivable devils! They beheaded my father... playing with their work as if it was all some sort of game... finally leaving with with a look of satisfaction on their face... The air was filled with a thunderous laugther... I still can't get it out of my mind...
What happened then?
Okay... I really have to leave
After they left... my mother told us of the secret of the treasure map... With her last gasp, my mother said... the treasure map points out a place... that hides... an ultra-powerful <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Blood Stone</FONT> and the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Deflector Shield Spell</FONT> that shuttles through the two worlds!  They were hidden away because the magic power of the Blood Stone was too powerful!  Countless valiants who had tried to dig up the treasure... to kill the evil <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Angry Princess</FONT>... all ended up badly wounded or even killed by the power of the stone... The Angry Princess hurried in order to take the map because the magic power of the Bright Shadow Valiant is looming... It threatens them...
What happened then?
The year is the Magic Power Year of the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Bright Shadow Valiant</FONT>, where the Valiant will be further empowered... This year it's exceptionally easy for the Valiant to take the Blood Stone... It's just that... the treasure map is currently being kept by the devils... I think that they are aiming to destroy the map... They are unable to approach the powerful weapons... therefore destroying the treasure map is the best they can do... I feel confident that this is what they intend to do...!
So what do we do?
The magic power of the treasure map is much weaker than that of the Blood Stone... But time and effort is still needed in order to destroy the treasure map... Therefore... before we must get it back before it is destroyed and then follow the instruction found on the map in order to find the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Blood Stone</FONT> and the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Deflector Shield Spell</FONT>!  Kill the devils... I will avenge my parents!
So... do you need my help?
Sorry... I can't help.
That would be splendid if you could help me... My siblings and I have found the camp of the three Imperial Guards of the Angry Princess... <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>The three devils live deep inside three towers</FONT>... It's tough to tell exactly what's going on inside... but after days of observation... we have made a small but significant discovery... We have found that the powers of the three devils seem to differ... The one which is my sister <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Mijin, appears to be the weakest</FONT>... My brother <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Mirya is somewhat stronger</FONT>... <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>The devil who tortured my father to death lives in the tower that I will take you to; he is certainly the strongest one</FONT>...  I think... attacking them one by one is our best strategy...
I will avenge you
We witnessed how fierce the Imperial Guards of the Angry Princess are... Do you need to make some preparations before you enter the Evil Spirit Area?!  We will wait here for you!  When you are prepared, we can set off... To avenge my parents...
Alright!  No problem!
No time! Gotta run!
We can go now!
Umm... okay!
Umm... okay!
Umm... Okay!  But if one day you find the time to listen to me for a while... and help us... My siblings and I would be very grateful...
Umm... okay!
Umm... Okay!  But if one day you find the time to listen to me for a while... and help us... My siblings and I would be very grateful...
The sealed Princess' Bone will do no more mischief for now! Valiant, it's all because of your efforts... Thank you! Thank you very much...  <FONT COLOR=#ffff00>(This mission can be re-obtained after an hour)</FONT>
Basic Conversation Mirya
I heard from my brother that the Blood Stone and the Deflector Shield Spell should be in the Southeast of the Sacred Hilltop... near the skull on the map... <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>My brother wants you to hurry to the Southeast of the Sacred Hilltop... to find the skull on the map...</FONT>   Find the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Blood Stone</FONT> and the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Deflector Shield Spell</FONT>!
Umm... I am going!
Maybe later...
My brother wants me to remind you... please keep the treasure map safe!  It is a key to the sacred weapons... If you lose it... <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>all your achievements will go in vain...!</FONT>  <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>So please keep this treasure map safe!</FONT>   Okay... now head to the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Southeast of Sacred Hilltop... to find the skull on the map...</FONT>!  <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Come back to my brother - Mijo with the complete treasure map when you have found the Blood Stone and the Deflector Shield Spell...</FONT>  Okay please go now... Have a safe journey...!
Umm... Okay!  So... keep the treasure map with you... But please keep it safe!  It is a key to the sacred weapons... If you lose it... <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>all your achievements will go in vain...!</FONT>  <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>So please keep this treasure map safe!</FONT>
This is... it! It's this one... It's the third one... <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Give these three to my brother - Mijo now</FONT>...!  He can read the ancient words on the skull!
Here... right! This is it... but why is there just a scrap?!  The remnants must be kept in the two Evil Spirit Areas guarded by my other two brothers!  We can't see the complete picture on this scrap... and I can't read the ancient words on the skull... <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Give it to my brother - Mijo when you have collected the complete treasure</FONT>...!  He can read them!

I cannot find any keys to the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Evil Spirit Area that I asked for</FONT> from you... You don't have the key to open the deeper <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>(King Nam's Tomb)</FONT> Area.
You must be the Valiant that the Giant Tower Investigators spoke of... Nice to meet you!  May I take the liberty of telling you a story?   A story about something that happened to me and my two siblings? May I?
Okay, I'm listening...
I have no time for this...
It happened a year ago...!  A treasure map handed down by our ancestors was taken away by <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>three women</FONT> who called themselves then <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Imperial Guards of the Angry Princess</FONT>... They didn't stop with just the map... Step by step, they came closer to us... Then there was a rustle from the ground, as if the Phantom was giving a fearful alert...
What happened then?
Ugh... I really have no time...
That night... Our parents defended us from the powerful attack with their bodies... In a flash, crimson red blood seemed to be everywhere... Staring at the sea of blood... the Imperiald Guards of the Angry Princess went mad, became sick and insane!  One of them, who appeared to be the leader, picked up his blazing broadsword and shouted... He continued shouting as he swiftly slashed down with his broadsword... Those people! They are devils!! Unforgivable devils! They beheaded my father... playing with their work as if it was all some sort of game... finally leaving with with a look of satisfaction on their face... The air was filled with a thunderous laugther... I still can't get it out of my mind...
What happened then?
Okay... I really have to leave
After they left... my mother told us of the secret of the treasure map... With her last gasp, my mother said... the treasure map points out a place... that hides... an ultra-powerful <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Blood Stone</FONT> and the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Deflector Shield Spell</FONT> that shuttles through the two worlds!  They were hidden away because the magic power of the Blood Stone was too powerful!  Countless valiants who had tried to dig up the treasure... to kill the evil <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Angry Princess</FONT>... all ended up badly wounded or even killed by the power of the stone... The Angry Princess hurried in order to take the map because the magic power of the Bright Shadow Valiant is looming... It threatens them...
What happened then?
The year is the Magic Power Year of the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Bright Shadow Valiant</FONT>, where the Valiant will be further empowered... This year it's exceptionally easy for the Valiant to take the Blood Stone... It's just that... the treasure map is currently being kept by the devils... I think that they are aiming to destroy the map... They are unable to approach the powerful weapons... therefore destroying the treasure map is the best they can do... I feel confident that this is what they intend to do...!
So what do we do?
The magic power of the treasure map is much weaker than that of the Blood Stone... But time and effort is still needed in order to destroy the treasure map... Therefore... before we must get it back before it is destroyed and then follow the instruction found on the map in order to find the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Blood Stone</FONT> and the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Deflector Shield Spell</FONT>!  Kill the devils... I will avenge my parents!
So... do you need my help?
Sorry... I can't help.
That would be splendid if you could help me... My siblings and I have found the camp of the three Imperial Guards of the Angry Princess... <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>The three devils live deep inside three towers</FONT>... It's tough to tell exactly what's going on inside... but after days of observation... we have made a small but significant discovery... We have found that the powers of the three devils seem to differ... The one which is my sister <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Mijin, appears to be the weakest</FONT>... My brother <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Mirya is somewhat stronger</FONT>... <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>The devil who tortured my father to death lives in the tower that I will take you to; he is certainly the strongest one</FONT>...  I think... attacking them one by one is our best strategy...
I will avenge you
We witnessed how fierce the Imperial Guards of the Angry Princess are... Do you need to make some preparations before you enter the Evil Spirit Area?!  We will wait here for you!  When you are prepared, we can set off... To avenge my parents...
Alright!  No problem!
No time! Gotta run!
We can go now!
Umm... okay!
Umm... okay!
Umm... Okay!  But if one day you find the time to listen to me for a while... and help us... My siblings and I would be very grateful...
Umm... okay!
Umm... Okay!   But if one day you would have time to listen to me... and help us...  My siblings and I will be very grateful...

I heard from my brother that the Blood Stone and the Deflector Shield Spell should be in the Southeast of the Sacred Hilltop... near the skull on the map... <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>My brother wants you to hurry to the Southeast of the Sacred Hilltop... to find the skull on the map...</FONT>  Find the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Blood Stone</FONT> and the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Deflector Shield Spell</FONT>!
Umm... I am going!

This is... it! It's this one... It's the third one...  <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Give these three to my brother - Mijo now</FONT>...!   He can read the ancient words on the skull!
Here... right! This is it... but why is there just a scrap?!   The remnants must be kept in the two Evil Spirit Areas guarded by my other two brothers!   We can't see the complete picture on this scrap... and I can't read the ancient words on the skull...  <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Give it to my brother - Mijo - when you have collected the entire treasure</FONT>!   He can read them!

One of them, who appeared to be the leader, picked up his blazing broadsword and shouted... He continued shouting as he swiftly slashed down with his broadsword... Those people! They are devils!! Unforgivable devils! They beheaded my father... playing with their work as if it was all some sort of game... finally leaving with with a look of satisfaction on their face... The air was filled with a thunderous laugther... I still can't get it out of my mind...
What happened then?
Okay... I really have to leave
After they left... my mother told us of the secret of the treasure map... With her last gasp, my mother said... the treasure map points out a place... that hides... an ultra-powerful <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Blood Stone</FONT> and the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Deflector Shield Spell</FONT> that shuttles through the two worlds!  They were hidden away because the magic power of the Blood Stone was too powerful!

Ohhh! Valiant, the glorious Valiant!   Please accept my salutation!  I was Jairo were here to admire your charm with me.
Ohh! Valiant, the glorious Valiant! I heard that you eliminated the Vampire Ghost who wanted to destroy the world of mortals. Thank you so much. What would we do without you?  Please accept my salutation! I wish Jairo were here to admire your charm with me.
Jairo, my beloved Jairo! I hope you come back to me as soon as possible. San Joel is in danger now. If anything bad happened, I don't want to be alone!
Here you are!  Thank God!  Hmm, the terrible man is attacking everyone like mad... I heard people called him Van Helsing!   Van Helsing? Who on earth is he? Why does he have the looks of a human, but also the teeth and claws of a vampire? Alas, it's so terrible!
Jairo thought it was too dangerous for me to stay with him, so I came back on my own. Alas! Missing someone is horrible!   Please take good care of yourself, you look tired and pale. I'm sure you must be too busy helping people in pain!  You are wonderful~
Jairo, my beloved Jairo!  We will soon be together~  Yay!  By the way, have you found Isabel?
Uhh... Jairo, I hate you! I just wanted to stay with him, but he forced me to leave! I told him he would get well soon. But why does he have doubts?   As long as he is here, no ghosts will terrify me. Why is he worrying all the time?
I am leaving for Jairo now, but I'm still worried about <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Isabel</FONT>. Please do me this favor. Help Uncle <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Granikov</FONT> find <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Isabel</FONT>!  Uncle <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Granikov</FONT> didn't say it, but I know he is chomping at the bit. <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Isabel</FONT> is his only daughter, please help him! Uncle <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Granikov</FONT> is now in the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Soul Lab</FONT>. I think he is not in a mood to work these few days!
Jairo, Uhh... I wanted to save you, but in the end I made you suffer.   Don't worry, if you will never recover, I will still be there for the rest of my life...
Thank you very much. I have to send Jairo this pill now!  By the way, if you have time, please pay a visit to Uncle <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Granikov</FONT> at the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Soul Lab</FONT> on my behalf? Lately he is very supset over Isabel. Thank you!
What? Flat is willing to help?   I have just met Jairo. I feel so bad for his suffering! Uhh...
Great to see you here. I think someone may be able to help us!
Go find him now!
Who is it?
Well... It's not appropriate for me to meet him... But if you won't help me... Uhh! I will go find him by myself, for the sake of my beloved Jairo...
Have you heard of <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>The Ogre Spirit Society</FONT>? The Ogre Spirit Society is for peace, therefore someone in the society must know of heresies.  In fact, I do not want to approach them, but for my beloved Jairo... I will try anything. So please help me find a Ghost Recruiter called <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Flat</FONT>, and tell him about Jairo's situation.   Please also tell him, if he can save Jairo, I, I... I am willing to go out with him...
I got it!
I don't do this kind of thing!
Uhh... Thank you.  I will wait for your good news here! Hope <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>The Ogre Spirit Society</FONT> is as powerful as Flat said...
Please help me once more! If you refuse me... then I... I will just go beg him by myself...
Uhh, my beloved Jairo. I cannot live without you! Who can save us?
What happened?
There are more choices.
Few days ago I met Jairo. He looked weird, pale, and sweating. Then he got ill that evening! I stayed over to take care of him...  Don't look at me with your <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>nasty</FONT> eyes, we did nothing! Anyway, around midnight he suddenly screamed painfully, and rushed to the door! Uhh, he looked so scary!
Where is he now?
Don't bother me with this!
I kept running after him. I saw him rushing towards the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Snowzone</FONT>.  Uhh, there are many ghosts. I couldn't stop him, but I am afraid they will hurt him. Please, can you help me find him?
Sorry, I am busy
I will go with you right now!
Uhhh, my beloved Jairo, the world is cruel... I know it now! If anything bad happened to you, I would be heart broken.  Uhhh... Uhhh... Uhhhhhhh...
Thank you, I saw him heading <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Northeast of the Snow Zone</FONT>! Please find him.  I will be waiting here!
It is not stupid! My Jairo was so sick. How heartless of you to say this! Go away, I don't need your help. Uhhh... go as far as you can!
What... what are you talking about? The bond between me and Jairo is beyond the comprehension  of you mortals. You are jealous because you never loved like we do. How sad!
Uhhh, Jairo, my beloved Jairo!

Is it true that something happened in San Joel? How is Manalie?   No! I have to go back for my Manalie!
My lovely Manalie, I so want to go back to you now!   But for your safety, I have to stay here for several days until I fully recover. Oh! It is so painful to be missing you. Manalie~ My sweetheart Manalie~~~
This kind man has cured me just now. Thanks for your blessing. I am slowly recovering now. But before I am fully recovered, I can't risk Manalie's safety by keeping her by my side.  There are so many ghosts and monsters here; it is too dangerous for a weak girl like her! Does she not know that I am worried? I made her leave for our eternal love Why does she not understand?
Gahh! Well... what... what is wrong with me...  Gahhh! Gahhh~uhhh~~~uhhhhh~

Uh! I know nothing. I didn't want to be a ghost recruiter, they made us. Go find him. I am also a victim!
Wow! You are wonderful! You defeated the Vampire God! Brilliant.  But don't forget our deal!
Hey! How are you? Haven't seen you for some time, you look smarter now.  (Whispers) Please keep the secret for me!
Wow! Who is the man who broke into San Joel? He has the look of a murderer. It's scary!
Hey! How are you? Haven't seen you for some time, you look smarter now.  (Whispers) Please keep the secret for me!
Master Sengen is brilliant. Only because of me, the tiny Jairo could be cured by our Ghost Party  Yinyang Master.   You, you didn't tell Master Sengen about this, did you?
You said Master Sengen cured the tiny Jairo? Did you mention me? That tiny boy I don't care, but I must not get involved.  Did you say it? Did you say it? Did you say it? Did you say it? Did you say it? Did you say it?
Hey... How are you doing? Are you going for <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Master Sengen</FONT>? He should have arrived <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>The Gate of  San Joel</FONT>!  One more thing! Please don't tell him how Jairo got poisoned. Just ask him about the antidote. Thank you!
When I think about how much time and effort I have spent just to save Jairo, I feel bad!   Eh? Why are you here? Did you pass it to my beloved Manalie? She should promise to go out with me!
Lalalala~ The weather is so~ good today, I feel great~  Oh, what do you want? To join our Society?
I am just a passer-by!
As for what I asked you...
Oh~really~  Alright, that is good! Heh... oh~ really~... Alright, that is good! Hey...
What did you asked me... What? Oh! You mean that issue! Oh! Don't worry, leave it to me. Hey~ <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Despite his kind heart, depite his prayers~ When the Ogre flowers bloom, When the moon is full, he will become a wolf~</FONT>   Hey, please don't mind. It is just a folk song! I have translated the words from the notes of the Wicked Herb Study. As you have just heard from the folk song, when <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Ogre flowers are bloom, and the moon is full</FONT>, Jairo will be incurable!   But you are lucky to have met me, his savior. According to the Wicked Herb Study: <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Antidotes are within the distance of seven steps from poisonous things. This is the universal principle of mutual generation and restriction</FONT>. But if you want to cure the Poison Fang Wolf, you must obtain the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Ogre Flower</FONT> of <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Ogre-faced Flower</FONT>!
I got it!
I have hay fever~
Oh, really? Then get the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Ogre Flower</FONT> of the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Ogre-faced Flower</FONT> now! Get back to me when you have found it. The ogre flower is very strong. If you take it in directly, your abdomen will get bloated and kill you.  Our Ogre Spirit Society is best at creating antidotes. Handling an orge flower is easy.  When you get it, you <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>must</FONT> bring it to me! I remember seeing <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>orge flowers</FONT> in the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Snowzone</FONT>. Go there and check it out.
Right! Just don't go if you don't want to. Hay fever is very uncomfortable when it breaks out!   Forget about this issue! Heh~
Lovely Manalie is so upset lately. But that's alright, she will get over it very soon.  Heh...
Hey girl, do you want to join our Ogre Spirit Society, and fight for world peace?   Aw~ why the long face? Heh! Let me tell you, there are many handsome guys in the world of ghosts. Doesn't it sound tempting?
Hey~ boy., do you want to join our Ogre Spirit Society, and fight for world peace?   Aw~ Why the long face? Heh! Let me tell you, there are many pretty girls in the world of ghosts. Doesn't it sound tempting?

Basic Conversation Sengen
Priestess, why do you not understand how I feel for you? I love you so much, but you chose Van Helsing.  I loathe you! I regret that I only helped you feign death, instead of killing you... If I hardened my heart, I would not have suffered from what I do now... I loathe it...
What did you say? You killed the Priestess! No! It can't be true! The Priestess is so powerful, how could she be defeated by a loser like you? No, I don't believe.  How about Van Helsing? Where is that damned man? I won't let him stay close to the Priestess. I won't let him. He took her away once already, there will not be a second chance... Uhh! (hematemesis)
I loathe you, you are the reason of my success and failure! I thought you could kill Van Helsing for me, but in the end the entire plan was all ruined by you. You even injured the Hell Digital Lord, and shook the ground of the Hell...  Don't think you have won! The Hell has a wealth of ghosts; the horrible and powerful King of Dignity awaits to destroy the world of mortals. Wait and see! How immortal are you to fight with them!
What are you still doing here? Go to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Amethyst Cave</FONT> to see the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Secret Swordman</FONT> Van Helsing! I bet he now feels like he is living in hell! Haha.  But you hateful demon forcefully pumped out my soul from the consciousness; it hurts me a lot! I still cannot even walk. I will keep it in my mind and take my revenge! Wait and see!
Oh! Doing well lately? (Looking volatile)  I heard you defeated Sara, the Vampire Goddess. That's good! You are great.
I heard you used the blood of Van Helsing to cure San Joel. So you really killed Van Helsing, haha! I'm sorry that I misunderstood you. Please don't mind.  I thought that you would be seduced by Van Helsing like how Batabi was! It will just come to bad ends.
I heard that you defeated Van Helsing, but did not kill him.  I don't even know what to say! No matter how many times I explain to you, you just won't listen.  Forget it! Please leave! If my words don't matter, let's not ever meet again!
Huh! These people were all brainwashed by Van Helsing! He must die in order to save them!
Van Helsing is a terrible man. He cast a spell on Batabi to make him loyal. But you have to tell right from wrong. Don't let them confuse you!
Batabi is with Van Helsing, so of course he will takes sides with Van Helsing. Don't get fooled by Batabi!   The fate of San Joel and the mortals is reliant on you!
Things have become so bad now. What are we to do? Alas!
What happened?
Today is a good day!
Van Helsing... he... he broke into San Joel, and forced his way into <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>St. Louis Church</FONT>. He attacked  many <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Holy Core Knights</FONT>, and threatened them saying if everyone discriminates him as a Hybrid, he will turn every mortal into a vampire, and make them suffer.  Fortunately I came out to cure Jairo, so that I escaped from the disaster. But now in <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>St. Louis Church</FONT> there are many injured, some even dying. As I got back to the city, I saw his words on the stone wall:   <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>The one who hurt me with the Silver Cross! I will vent my anger on your people. I will use your blood to wash away my loathing heart. As the moon rises, we must have our final fight!</FONT>   Well... Van Helsing is giving you this <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Letter of Challenge</FONT>. You have to fight with him!
No, I am scared!
I will go for him now!
Even you are scared! So is mankind doomed to be destroyed?
Relax. You'd better go to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>St. Louis Church</FONT> to visit the injured, and ask them more about the situation!
It's a good day, but <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>San Joel</FONT> is facing a catastrophic disaster!
Hahaha! Did you kill Van Helsing?   That cursed man should have died, but it is still not too late. Well done!
He is still alive...
Ha ha ha ha!
What? You didn't kill him! Don't you know you'll have the devil to pay for letting him go? You must have been cheated by his smooth talking, is that why you showed mercy on him?   Aw! You are so naive! I don't know what he said to you, but you must not believe him! It was his smooth talking that fooled poor young girl <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Baby</FONT> and many simple-minded people. After all he is one of the devil clan. He cannot control the berserker inside him, he killed <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Baby</FONT>... Uhhh! Such an innocent and young girl had such a bad ending. Tell me, how can we leave such a devil alive?   Before he recovers, kill him. Otherwise we won't get the chance again!
Ok! I'm going right now.
No I won't!
Go now! Van Helsing is lucky to meet kind dumb-bells.
You... If you you don't listen to me, the world of mortals will be doomed.
Ha ha ha ha ha ha...
Very well, ha ha ha! Van Helsing thought he could escape from it; he wishes! There IS justice in the world; he will soon get what he deserves. You must be wondering what is going on!  Van Helsing has the look of a human, but he is in fact a hybrid! His father is the father of the vampire <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Sara, the Vampire Goddess</FONT>! Sara is a cursed devil; he is doomed to be immortal and despised by the mankind forever.  As the son of Sara, Van Helsing inherits the curse. With his human mask he stays among the mankind. Apparently he leads human to fight with ghosts; as the matter of fact, he is one of the ghosts, conspiring to destroy world peace.
Go on!
I don't want to. Goodbye!
I told you, many years ago Van Helsing went to hell alone, and fought with several hundred devils. In the end he suddenly threw away his armor, and escaped to the world of mortals. That is the rumor among humans.  But in fact, his immortal side was discovered by me, so before I exposed it, he escaped to the hell. But Sara was angry that he didn't complete his job, and kicked him out of hell. So he ran back to the world of mortals, and hid himself! The evil Van Helsing cheated the entire world, everyone thought that he is a hero, but he is evil.  He even allured the innocent girl Baby and killed her. That is why I saw who he actually is. Poor Baby! She was such a beautiful and pure girl. But she met the wrong guy, and became the victim of a devil.
I said I don't want to hear!
We must show him justice
I know you feel guilty for attacking Van Helsing. But now don't you think he is a devil?   This kind of evil must die. If you don't want to kill him, forget it! I will find some way else to eliminate him!
Right! Before he fully recovers, kill him to prevent the disaster!   His existence is a terrible bomb to mortals. For the safety of the world, please kill Van Helsing!
Please stay. You hurt Van Helsing. It is a perfect chance to kill him. Are you giving up such a good chance? He is the son of the devil!
You are hesitating. What is wrong?
It doesn't end here...
Nothing~
Alas, the poison on your friend is not yet cleared! But how do you know the Healing Stone cannot cure this poison?   (Carefully listening)... You said you saw a mysterious Swordsman, with a single spectacle and a cool look. He even knows the magic spell of Healing Stone? It's him... It's him... He is there...  I have searched for him for so many years, but by coincidence I finally found out where he is.   Hahahahaha! Wonderful. Thank God...
Who is he?
I don't care!
That man is rumored to be the most powerful swordsman <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Van Helsing</FONT>! Many years ago with his knives, he went to the hell alone, and killed many devils. A fearless daredevil!   But when he was faced by the Demon Lord, he suddenly gave up and went back to the world of mortals, and has been hiding himself since then! No one knows what happened to make him leave the two worlds suddenly. Ha! (with a cold smile) But I know it very well... Now we have to try a radical method to save your friend. Keep this <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Silver Cross</FONT> and find Van Helsing again.  Remember! When you see him, attack him with this <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Silver Cross</FONT> before he moves! Don't worry. Just do it. Defeat him with one big attack!   I know you are confused, but just don't ask. Remember, do it, and you will save your friend. You don't have much time, take the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Silver Cross</FONT> now to do what you should. I will explain to you afterwards.   Go--
Well... Ok!
What? No!
Don't be afraid! You can do it. When you have made it, I will tell you why you have to do this!
Um~ You don't have enough space. Please tidy up your bag or buy the Scroll of Bag Expansion.
It is about the life of your friend. If you don't do it, your friend will be incurable! Do you want to see him die, or become a vampire?
No, don't! You can't give up at this stage. Do you want your friend to live in pain in the rest of his life?   Don't forget Healing Stone cannot cure him!
That is good! Hope your friend will be safe and free from any accident!
The spiritual land in the south of San Joel, <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Amethyst Cave</FONT> has a kind of very special mineral stone called <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Healing Stone</FONT>, it may give your friend some relief.  <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Healing Stone</FONT> can be found in <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>the southern part of the cave</FONT>. The exact location I am not sure, but I know many valiants go there for it. Allegedly there is a <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>mysterious swordsman</FONT> who knows everything about it, you can ask him.
Jairo seems fine. His good friend has come to see him! But for some reason they started to argue...  Youth is great~
Are you here for Jairo?   Don't worry. I gave him an acupuncture and fed him with Millennium Mushroom! He is recovering very well, but is still very weak, so let him stay here.
I am heading to Snowzone to cure your friend Jairo. If you have time, please let his family and friends know. Tell them not to worry, because I will do my best to cure him!   I have to go now, and will come back as soon as I cure Jairo. For any problems, come here to find me.
You are sweating and look very anxious. Why?
Here is the story!
Nothing!
What? It sounds bad. Spiritual beings who become monsters and ghosts have enormous spiritual power. If the power is not refined, the gallant nature won't be removed.  You said you friend had an Ogre Flower and is on the verge of insanity, because the poison in the flower. Ogre flowers are poisonous and cold. Ordinary people having taken it will die within several days. It is incurable, unless... Unless you find the rare <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Millennium Mushroom</FONT>. <font COLOR=#00ff00>Millennium Mushroom</FONT> gathers the spiritual essences of nature; it is the remedy to all illnesses and poisons. Ill ones who take it will recover; healthy ones who take it will grow even stronger.  But <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Millennium Mushroom</FONT> is too rare. Don't give up. I heard that the southern spiritual land <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Amethyst Cave's northern part</FONT> was seen to have <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Millennium Mushroom</FONT>. You can go there to find. If you find it, bring it back to me right away.
I will leave later!
I am leaving shortly!
His life is reliant on you. There is no time to waste. Miss the chance and you will regret forever!
Be care. I will pause my preaching. Go now! I will wait for your good news here.
That's great! Peace is bliss. I wish every mortal peace, safety and happiness.
I felt uneasy as I first came here. Watch out!   Oh! My friend, it's such a perfect time to see you. Our Ogre Spirit Society is for peace! Would you like to join us and endeavor for peace together?

Isala, baby, go to sleep. The sun is setting, the birds go home, the stars are smiling.  My baby, go to sleep~ Go to sleep~ Uhhhhhh...
Isala, don't you know everything daddy does is for you? Alas!
Isala...! Isala, where are you? Why don't you understand what I did for you? Daddy doesn't want you to suffer with an unpromising man! Did I do anything wrong?  Um, who are you? Why are you here suddenly? Did you make an appointment with my assistant?
I am just walking around~
Manalie sent me over!
It is my temporary office. Please go out and do not disturb me. I have a lot to do, I have no time to chat with you!
Who is Manalie? Oh! I remember. It is Isala's friend!   Thanks for your concern. I know Manalie means to leave just to make me angry! I don't think her leaving has anything to do with Werewolf!    It's all Arilan's fault. He cheated and seduced Isala. Isala is an elite receiving high education, how can she be with an ordinary man? I will not let it happen!    Isala used to be very obedient, but she argued with me just because of him. It makes me mad! That is just one last thing I can do... Oh! I am too careless!   A rash man like Arilan may hurt Isala when he is mad. Isala may be in danger...    Young man, please help me find Isala. But this has to be kept secret. Don't let anyone know. Can you do this?
No!
Certainly~
What...! Forget it. I will do it myself.
Good, good. Young man, if you can find Isala, I will give you a huge reward. But remember, it must be a secret.  Someone in the town disappeared, it will upset everyone. If others know even my daughter is missing, the consequence would be horrible.
I will keep it secret!
It has nothing to do with me.
Oh! Liars and gossipy people are everywhere, including this place! When you pass by San Joel, you will see a man called <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Kyson</FONT>!   He is a friend of the hateful Arilan. I think he must know something about Isala. Please try to ask him. Perhaps I can ask something out of him.
It's none of your business. As a science leader, I am obligated to protect the residents.  If you insist to spread it out, there is nothing I can do! But I won't let you stay here any bit longer.
Isala... Isala... Where are you? How can you even leave your father alone just because of love?
<font COLOR=#00ff00>Isala</FONT>, where are you? Did she run away with the unpromising boy? That's impossible! The night of full moon is gone, Arilan should have...  Oh? Who are you? What are you doing here?
I am just here to visit...
I heard that your daughter...
That's good! The town is not having a peaceful time lately. Stay in somewhere safe and avoid going out.
My daughter! Isala is fine! Why are you asking this? Mind your own business.  I heard that you are going out with the beautiful <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Manalie</FONT>, you'd better go find her! Don't disturb me. I am busy!
(mumbling) The town is not having a peaceful time lately. The wolves are howling. Did I... Did I go too far?...  But Isala is my daughter; I can't let such an unpromising man take her away. Arilan, blame it on your fate...
The town is not having a peaceful time lately. Especially in the nighttimes, the wolves are howling.  Things have run out of control. What should I do?
My science triumphs as the world's most developed civilization; but it doesn't satisfy me. I will develop the industry, train researchers to develop and invent better products in order to give everyone a happy life!   How about you? What is your wish?

Aw! Valiant, your temper is too bad to tolerate. You don't have many friends, do you? If you are upset, let's just forget it. I believe with my love for Isala, I will be able to find her.
Phew, phew! Eh? I saw Isala and Arilan running in. Where are they now?

Oh! I am feeling great, not even one bit of illness!   I am still missing the taste of raw beef ribs!
It's strange. Why am I feeling dizzy? Perhaps the blood serum is too poisonous.  I wonder how the swordsmen are doing.
Friend, did you help me to ask about the man called Sengen? I heard that he is great. Thank you!
Hiss-- How is Mr. Granikov? I rarely have a chance to see him! The hateful Lutran stopped me. It's so bad.  Hiss-- Teeth are itchy!
Pig blood cakes are delicious. Spicy duck blood is not bad, too. Adding a glass of tomato juice will be perfect~

Huh~ Oh, our San Joel hero is here. Please applaud!   Hands clapping~
Huh~ Sorry! After my calculation, I think hosting a welcome party is such a waste of money. Now that you are here, let me give you the award now!   Please accept this award for everything you did for us! Please applaud. Hands clapping~
Huh~ Are you going to make trouble with the devils again? Please behave yourself, don't cause us any trouble.  Now that something happened to Granikov, the safety of the entire town is my responsibility. I have to be extra careful, please understand!
Huh~ The award presentation is being prepared. Ask about the time later.
Huh~ I was wondering who was brave enough to defeat Sara, so it's you!   Not bad, you are brilliant. We have decided to give you a prize and a honor title. I will let you know when the time is confirmed.
Huh~how impertinent is Van Helsing to attack San Joel! (afterthought)   Though those he hurt are from the mainstream, he must pay for his misbehavior in San Joel!   I have sent outstanding fighters from my society to 'finish' him! I am sure they are coming back with good news.
Larth is lucky. Huh~ How can he have a man here who risk his life for this boy?
Huh~ My pioneering devil detector has just detected a strong wave of evil power; which means hordes of ghosts or demon lords are now in San Joel.  But the strangest part is the wave suddenly disappeared, and San Joel hasn't been attacked. Is this machine out of order?

Huh~ Is the matter with Larth settled? Huh~ My tolerance is running out.  I do not accept 'it's fine for now'. I cannot put anything at risk!
Huh~ How is the matter with Larth?   Basically 'clearing him' is the easiest way, once and for all.
Huh~ I told you. The lives of the young nowadays are too good. They have never suffered, and run away just for trivial matters. Who can they blame for their bad ends? Poor Mr. Granikov.  Mr. Granikov is too heartbroken to handle the business, I am doing the job for him now. Everyone feels sorry for Isala. But I admire your ability. I have a job for you. Interested?
Sorry, I don't want to do!
Tell me.
What? (Angry) Huh~ It's up to you! At the time when things expose, you won't be able to escape too. Huh~
Huh~ If I didn't hear it myself, I wouldn't believe that Mr. Granikov joined force with the devils to hurt our citizens. Therefore I think the recent abnormal behaviours of vampire expert <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Larth</FONT> is related to this issue!
Mind what you say!
Why?
Huh~ Leave if you don't believe me. Don't waste our time!
Huh~ <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Larth</FONT> has been studying <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>vampires</FONT> for decades; he knows everything about <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>vampires</FONT>. If we have any questions, we always ask him.  But recently he seldom goes out, with his door and windows closed. He seems very mysterious. Everyone is spreading rumors about him. Someone heard something howling in his house; someone even saw bats flying around his place. It's so strange! I guess something secretive happened on him. So I want you to pay him a visit, and see if he is still human.  I don't mean to doubt about him, but vampires are just like Werewolf, they <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>demonize mortals to be one of them</FONT>... I hope you get what I mean!
I got it!
I don't get it!
Huh~ Then go to find <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Larth</FONT> now! He lives in <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>the eastern part of the town</FONT>.
... I didn't know you are so stupid. I need some time to think if I should ask you for help! Huh~

Baby... She... (with tears in the sharp eyes)   Please... Go with me to find <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Lilith</FONT>. Maybe she has another <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Revive Ruby</FONT>...
I dare not to go again!
You have my word!
... Alas! Never mind... If you are not willing, I will just go by myself...   My good friend, thanks for your help all along. Goodbye, I hope we will meet again!
I have seen the terrible power of Lilith; it is beyond the imagination of a mortal. This is a very dangerous mission. Get yourself prepared, and come back to me when you are ready.
Don't turn me down, okay?
Thank you, after taking <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Revive Ruby</FONT> my mind is a lot clearer, and I don't feel pain anymore! There is even a pure and strong spiritual power within me. I have never felt so powerful before!    But I feel uneasy to have such a sacred item used on a sinner like me.  One more thing, just now <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Batabi</FONT> came here to find you; he looked really anxious. He told me to give you this message: please go to the castle and find him as soon as possible.   Haha! Since when are you two so close, even closer than you and me?
Ahh... Arghhh! I feel painful, my whole body is exploding! Blood... My blood is burning! Ah... Arghhh, I, I cannot control myself...  What is happening? Isn't Sara dead already? Arghhhhhhh... Kill me... Now!
No way!
I will find a way to save you
Don't hesitate. There must be something problem. Do it now! Otherwise I don't know what I will do...
In the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Sacred Hilltop</FONT>, <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Maribela</FONT> knows how to save me. But I'm afraid I cannot wait... Things have become so bad... I will kill myself, so that I won't hurt the innocent... Thank you... For helping me.  ... No matter what happens, you are my savior... Remember if I am already incurable when you come back, please kill me with your own hands... Ah! It's painful... Go now! I don't know how long I can wait...
What do you want?
I am just walking around!
I defeated Sara...
(smile) Do you like this place too?    This cave is particularly memorable to me. Every time when I come here I feel very peaceful...
... (silence)... (sigh)...  I don't know if I should be happy or sad... But thank you anyway, for all you have done for me and others. I hope you will be forever ardent and righteous. The mankind will be proud of you.  I don't care about everything of the outside world now, but I must remind you that San Joel is facing a disaster, and it is not out of nowhere. Think over it carefully. Who on earth stirred it up?   The most important thing is, I hope you can stop him from causing more troubles!
What are you talking about?
You mean...
... Forget it. Innocence is bliss
I am sure you know who I am talking about!   For quite a few times he failed to attack me when he almost did it. He must be mad! Haha~
Are Maximilian and others alright? I am sure you will put an end to it.  Thank you. I'm useless. I cannot face them. Alas, especially Sandra... Alas!   But please tell her to forget the unfortunate man like me! I am fated to be forever solitary...
What are you coming here for?
Huh~ You want to save people? Go to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Vampire Castle</FONT>!
Hahahaha, hahahahahaha...
Hahahaha, hahahahahaha...
I loathe mortals. I am killing you all!
If you have any doubt about what they say, verify it. <font COLOR=#00ff00>Sengen</FONT> is evil and narrow-minded, albeit his kind and passionate look!   Every time when I think of how this hypocrite ruined my life, my anger burns fiercely!
Huh! You have found me! I don't fear death, just kill me! Otherwise go away. I am the son of God of Vampire, I will kill you all mortals!
I have something to do; I ought to go now. But let me remind you, Healing Stone will not entirely cure your friend. To clear his poison, you have to use something else.  But I have something to do now, I cannot tell you in detail. How about this? If your friend's illness gets worse, go to Sacred Hilltop and find a child called Clone. He will tell you where I am.
Who are you? What are you doing here?
Here is the story...
I am just a passer-by!
(frown) Did it really happen? Your friend is audacious! Fostering a vampire is suicide. But it happened already, what matters now is to save him.  This <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Healing Stone</FONT> is magical, but really rare because it is too precious! Therefore many ghosts want to get it. It is not easy to get one.
I won't give up!
Forget it!
Very fine! I admire your righteous characters. Seeing you are so dedicated, let me help you.  Come back to me when you are well prepared, I will tell you what to do!
Eh, be careful as you leave. The ghosts here are very powerful. Always stay alert.
Oh! Watch out. The ghosts here are very powerful.
Solitude is human's best friend. It is everywhere, even when you are among a crowd...
Child, it's dangerous here. Leave right now!

Basic Conversation with Clone the Child
I haven't seen Master Van Helsing for a very long time.  Tell me where he is. Is he not coming back anymore... (sob)
I haven't seen master Van Helsing for a very long time. Where has he been?
Uh! How is Master Van Helsing?
Uh! How is Master Van Helsing?   A terrible roar came out from his room. What happened?
You are so cute~ Let's play together~
Basic Conversation with Batabi
I didn't know that... Mimian was for real... Uh! How could I have thought of that? The empress of the world of death, a heartless evil girl would fall in love with Van Helsing.  Looking at Van Helsing I feel very sorry... Tell me, did I do anything wrong?
Please don't say that I am cruel. Mimian had a bad history. She played dead to cheat Van Helsing and revived his evil nature. If you didn't give him Revive Ruby, Van Helsing will have to struggle with his evil side for the lifetime!   Therefore how can I not be cautious to Mimian? How can I not suspect her? Alas. I wonder how Van Helsing is now. The fact that Mimian died must have broken him into pieces.  I'm so worried about him, but I am slow. Can you go ahead to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Amethyst Cave</FONT> and see how he is? Please! I'm so worried about him.
Thank God! You are back finally! I heard that you got the legendary <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Revive Ruby</FONT> and saved Van Helsing. I didn't know that <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Revive Ruby</FONT> is real. With such a magical remedy, Van Helsing will be fine!   I know my sudden invitation must confuse you. I think Van Helsing should have told you about his story with <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Baby</FONT>! Actually <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Baby</FONT> is not only the daughter of devil; in the world of mortals, she has another identity, which is the Priestess of <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Ogre Spirit Society</FONT> <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Mimian</FONT>.   She is the daughter of a fallen angel, beautiful but - like her father - ambitious to conquer the world. She cheated Van Helsing to revive his evil nature for her conspiracy. Later Baby played dead and revived the fallen Van Helsing successfully. However Van Helsing finally overcame his evil side, and destroyed <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Baby</FONT>... No! It's the plan of <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Mimian</FONT>.  <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Mimian</FONT> cannot do it on her own, so she was defeated and left. All these years I thought she stayed in Hell. I didn't know... I didn't know she is hiding in <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Vampire Castle</FONT>!
It doesn't matter!
What should I do?
It is serious! <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Mimian</FONT> is still here; she must be undergoing some bad plans. I am sure it must be related to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>invading the karma land</FONT>. Stay alert!
Of course <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>to eliminate</FONT> her! But for this matter do not let Van Helsing know. He had a tough time getting over with the pain of betrayal, I don't want to remind him of that.  More important is I'm afraid... I'm afraid he would have mercy on Mimian! This evil woman should have gone back to hell after the failure, but she hasn't given up her plan.  Members of the Ogre Spirit Society are active in all over the world; they must know the plan. Now that Van Helsing has recovered from the pain and lives a peaceful life; she orders Sengen to use you to feed her greed.   All troubles that have happened lately, she must have told Sengen to do all these. She is heartless, cruel; she forced Van Helsing to face the pain again!   If she is not killed, our world will be in danger, and Van Helsing will never get peace. So we must <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>eliminate</FONT> her!
Let me think...
I agree!
Don't think! <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Mimian</FONT> is still here. She must be undergoing some plans. We must destroy it before she starts!
Okay! My good friend, I know you would agree with me. Let me tell you one more thing: the real identity of Mimian in hell is the empress of the world of death, <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Hera, the Goddess of Death</FONT>.   I didn't know that <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Hera</FONT>, who is hiding in the third level of the castle, is <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Mimian</FONT>. But after you defeated Sara, I managed to get deeper into the castle.  Outside the room of Mimian, there is <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>a sword</FONT> -- The sword of Van Helsing's! I recognized it right away. Huh! She was showing off the put that sword outside her room.   I sneaked into the room, and saw <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Mimian</FONT> turning into <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Hera</FONT>... That was terrible! That's her real face...  Mortals always get fooled by appearance, and neglect the nature of evil.   So remember, don't get fooled by illusion. You must eliminate <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Hera</FONT> before she turns back to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Mimian=</FONT>!
Well~ I am a bit scared!
I am going now!
No worries! I am sure you can make it.  I think you must not have got yourself prepared for this. Never mind! Think over it, and come back to tell me later.
The Goddess of Death has a terrible power; she kills with her eyes. But don't be afraid. I had left a sacred deflector shield in the room to counter her deadly gaze   So don't worry, fight with her! She hides herself behind <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>the Sword of Death</FONT>. I will wait for your good news here! May Bewen Feili bless you.
My heart is beating so fast for some reason. Did anything bad happen? Oh! Glad to see you here. How is Van Helsing? He should be fine!   If it is alright, please go to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Amethyst Cave< /FONT> and pay him a visit for me!
You are brilliant! You even killed the Goddess of Vampire, and took Van Helsing out from hell!   But that guy has run to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Amethyst Cave</FONT> to be a <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>secret swordsman</FONT>! Tell him about Sara when you have time!
Wait, where are you rushing to? You hands are glowing! Oh! It's not a right time for compliment.  Let me tell you a bad news. Sara knew that Van Helsing wants to get rid of the hell, and got furious. He wants to send an army of vampires to attack San Joel. I think now only you can stop him!   Defeat him before he casts the spell, so that he won't be able to call on the army; then San Joel will be safe! According to my investigation, Sara lives in <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Vampire Castle 3F</FONT>.   We rely on you to eliminate Sara now. Our lives are now in your glowing hands. Do your best!
Eh? I'm nervous!
Let me do it!
Don't be afraid, you are powerful! Don't worry! Come on, take a deep breath! Inhale~ Exhale~ Inhale~ Exhale~
May Bewen Feili bless you~
I am happy to see that the misunderstanding between you and Van Helsing is resolved~
Hahaha! I am such a dumb-bell. I forgot to tell you that Van Helsing is now in <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Amethyst Cave</FONT>. Well... You know, he is the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>secret swordsman</FONT>! Go there and find him to take the remedy for Maximilian and Sandra. Van Helsing you could help him save his old partners. Now he is not dead, so he can't come out to save them by himself. So please! He is now very upset, console him!
I don't want to go~
I got it!
Eh? Really? Don't be so cruel!
Wish you good luck! My brave savior!
Van Helsing is in the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>2F room</FONT>, like his home there is a <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>blood cross</FONT> on the door. Follow the instructions to enter. Please, merciful Bewen Feili! Wish there won't be any casualty in this battle.
Please~ Don't bother Van Helsing anymore! Trust me, he is not the man that you think he is.
Don't ask me. I don't know anything!
Well... To ask about Van Helsing, go to the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Sacred Hilltop</FONT> and ask <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Mariana</FONT> or <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Maribela</FONT>. I... I don't know anything!
Uhhh--van Helsing, please hold on to it. Don't let it happen again!
Ill--  Sticky, it is the digestive juice of the disgusting monsters! It stinks~~~
Uhhh--  H, help~~~
Uhhh--  H, help~~~
Uh, alas! A monster is staring at me. What should I do? Should I ask him to save me? No, I cannot bother him. I can only pray.  Merciful Bewen Feili! Please save me. Don't make me the prey of the devil~
May Bewen Feili bless you~
Basic Conversation with Mariana
The riot in the Vampire Castle is over! Now it's like a ruin, with no devil inside! It's unbelievable!   Hero. Don't lie to me. It's you who fought with them and eliminated them! Everyone in the Sacred Hilltop knows about your legacy. I admire you! It's my greatest honor to meet you!
There was a huge shake in the castle just now. It has never been so powerful before!   What happened inside the castle?
Valiant! You really found Revive Ruby? That's miraculous! I thought it's just a treasure in the legend! Perhaps a lot of legends are true.
Valiant! Everyone in the Sacred Hilltop knows about your legacy. Thank you! I admire you!
As I observed just now, there was a huge shake in the castle! What happened?   Do you know, my friend?
Be careful. I'm sorry that we cannot help!
Thank you, Maribela is up now. I'm relieved!
Aw, poor Maribela. What should I do?   She took action without approval. If reported she must be punished, but I cannot leave her alone. What on earth should I do?
This place is so beautiful~
What is bothering you?
So beautiful... (spaced out)
Eh? Nice meeting you. You must be the hero who saved Batabi! He told me about you... Oh! Perhaps... Perhaps I can ask you to save Maribela.  Maribela and I station here under orders, to observe and supervise any activity inside <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>the Vampire Castle</FONT>. This castle is a camp of the vampire family, we ought to keep eyes on them!  Vampires torture the mortals for many years; we have always been attacked by them. Therefore the holy see sent us to here to grasp every movement of <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>the Vampire Castle</FONT>.  Everything is under control, but suddenly something happened on my partner Maribela. Look at her now, it's because she took action without approval. I cannot report it. Do you understand?
I can help!
I'm busy!
Thank you very much! This castle is owned by the notorious <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Dracula</FONT> ; but after years of investigation, I found that the God of Vampire <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Sara</FONT> also hides inside. To eliminate them all does good to the world!   But as we were about to report this, <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Van Helsing</FONT>... The legendary man who disappeared for years suddenly rushed into the castle, and did not come out since then! Maribela used to work with <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Van Helsing</FONT>. Since she didn't see <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Van Helsing</FONT> coming out, she got nervous and rushed into it...   I could not stop her; I just followed her. But she was attacked as she just stepped into the castle. At that moment <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Van Helsing</FONT> suddenly appeared! He handed the fainted Maribela to me, but she was already petrified.
It's none of my business.
Tell me what to do.
We are all human, please don't' be so cruel to her. <font COLOR=#00ff00>Van Helsing</FONT> used to work with her. Of course she felt agitated to see a senior that she hadn't seen for ages.  Moreover... I think <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Van Helsing</FONT> was looking weird: hollow-eyed, acting crazy. I have to find out the truth!
I brought Maribela back to here, and briefly checked her body. I found this hair in her hand... Seeing the color and its texture, it seems to be the hair of <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>cats</FONT>. After that Maribela woke up, and became such soulless.  Eh... Have you heard of a kind of monsters like <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Cat Girl</FONT> ? They are kept by the Blood Family, good at <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>soul enslavement</FONT>. Their <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Cat's Bell</FONT> can enslave a human soul.   Maribela is tough, the cats inside <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>the Vampire Castle</FONT> wouldn't be able to hurt her, unless the most powerful <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Cat Lady of the White Night</FONT> was among them. Given her condition now, Maribela was very probably attacked by the cat girl's <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>soul enslavement</FONT>. To make her recover we must first get the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Cat's Bell</FONT> that confines her soul!
Going to castle now!
I got it!
Thank you, I will wait for your good news here!
Thank you, I will wait for your good news here!
Well... It's about her life. If possible, please help us! How about this? You can finish your work first, and then come back to me?   Besides you there is no one I can ask for this favor. It's my fault! Only if I were stronger, I could have saved Maribela. I'm useless...
Being able to station in the legendary sacred land is my honor! Looking at the white mountains every day is like looking at the mysterious sacred man nagging the fourth sacred prince!
Basic Conversation with Maribela
Everyone in the Sacred Hilltop knows about your legacy. Thank you for doing so much for us!    Did you hear anything about Van Helsing?
I don't know!
Actually he...
Really? Thanks anyway.  ... Van Helsing... Sigh...
... No matter what... I just wish him safe... Actually I knew about him and Baby a long time ago...   I just hope one day happiness will come... I wish them forever happiness...  (tears in eyes)
... Van Helsing... Sigh...
Congratulations for finding such a rare treasure... (pondering)   Is this thing able to help Van Helsing...
Well... How is Van Helsing now? I... I am so worried about him.
There was a fierce fight in the castle just now. How is Van Helsing? Is he alright?   I am so worried Van Helsing, do you know how much I am worried about you? Uh...
Please help Van Helsing! Please~
Aw... My head is aching... What's wrong with me? Eh? Van Helsing... Van Helsing...  Eh? Who are you? Why are you staring at me?
Funny you look soul-less
Are you feeling better?
How rude are you! Get away!
I am alright, I'm just worried about Van Helsing. It's been many years. I thought he had already...  I felt so happy to see him! But he looked scary, I was so worried. I'm sorry, I didn't obey the order and took action without any approval. I made you guys worried!   I followed Van Helsing into the castle, but then I saw the geeky <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Dracula</FONT>.  He wanted to... To bewitch me (blush), but I gave him a slap on his face. And then I heard an angry roar, then I passed out!
Leaving now as all is okay
I am getting into the castle!
Oh! Goodbye, thanks for your help. (smile)
Are you looking for Van Helsing? Please be quick. I'm so worried about him! I'm afraid anything bad will happen to him. It's my fault, I am not strong enough to break into the castle!   Right I remember, Van Helsing's good friend, <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Batabi</FONT>, is in there. Please go find him, and help him save Van Helsing before it is too late. Van Helsing will... Uh!
I'm tired!
I got it!
But, but... Uh! I can't bear to see Van Helsing turning again into... Mariana, what should we do?
Thank you, I don't know how to show my gratitude.  I cannot help Van Helsing, but please bring him back... Uh!
... Um... Um...
The scenery is so beautiful here, but not far away there is a ghastly castle. What a shame.
Basic Conversation with Sarah
Van Helsing and Baby... (sigh) Actually I know Van Helsing will never forget her. He is such a stubborn man...  But thanks for telling me this... (with tears in eyes)
Van Helsing is fine! Oh! Thank you, Bewen Feili for forgiving my stupidity and getting Van Helsing out of danger.  I want to see him, but... He doesn't want to see me! After all he only loves the devil woman...
God! My stupidity almost sent Van Helsing to death...  Is he alright now? I so want to be with him now. But after all he loves me not, seeing me won't make him happy... He still misses the evil woman! Uh...
You are a true valiant, valorous and brave. Please accept my worship!   Now that Sara is dead, I think Van Helsing could have a peaceful life again... Actually I hope he would go back here and guide us...
Eh, have you got the sacred power? Go to the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Vampire Castle</FONT> and eliminate <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Sara</FONT>. If he dies, Van Helsing will be relieved!
Van Helsing... Uh! You don't even come here to take one look at me. Do you know I have been waiting for you?
Heheh I heard that!
He asked me to tell you...
Who, who are you? How dare you to eavesdrop on me? Get away! (Blush)
What? He still remembers me, and he doesn't mean to hurt me? Uh! I'm so happy. I thought he had forgotten about me...  Until now I didn't know he is a hybrid, though we have known each other for so many years... He has been suffering the pain all alone, it is really killing me. No! I can't let him live with pain. I must put an end to it!  Actually the opened seal cannot be sealed again, but I can stop it from breaking out again! I know there must be a way out.
What to do?
Tell him by yourself.
Kill <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Sara</FONT>! The dominating power will vanish forever! When <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Sara</FONT> is dead, the evil nature inside Van Helsing will not break out again! But <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Sara</FONT> is too terrible, it's impossible to kill him. But sacred and pure blood can weaken him and send him back to hell!   I heard that at the highest point of the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Sacred Hilltop</FONT>, there is a <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Blood Sample Jar</FONT> containing the blood of Goddess. Soak your hand in her blood, and any ordinary weapon or magic will be an invincible weapon in your hand!   But the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Blood Sample Jar</FONT> is guarded by many spiritual animals. It is not easy to approach it. But I think you are capable of taking on this challenge. What do you think? Want to give it a try?
I don't want to go!
Of course!
... You disappointed me. Forget it! As I am fully recovered, I will go there by myself. I won't bother you!
That's great! You have to be careful, that <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>monster that protects the four spirits</FONT> is very powerful, you shouldn't underestimate its power. But I must remind you <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>The jar of precious blood's</FONT> holy power, all of the people can only use that <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>one</FONT> time in their life time. Also, there's time restriction; if you accomplish the mission this time, you have to hurry up before the holy power disappear and rush to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>the castle of the vampire</FONT> destroy <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Cain</FONT>! Take care!
Huh? He won't see me and I don't know his whereabouts, can't you help him?
Argh--it's harder and harder to endure... Arrrrrrrrr...  Van Helsing... Your cruel heart...
Argh--my throat is so dry... Arrrrrrrrr...
Oh... He... He forgot about me... He also hurt me that heavily. Am I never comparable to Baby? Pain... The pain on my wound, it can never be compared to the pain in my heart...
Uhhh... Van Helsing... Why did you do that?  The thing that I get for return for waiting for you so many years is cruel slap from you...
Hi! Hello! Are you here for a visit? Cathedral of St. Rui has a very long history and it's built by the pope of the early century, Saint-Sialon. It also became the land of us, the Rose knight.

Basic Conversation about Dark Repair
Van Helsing... That guy is not dead?  If he's not dead then come back! We're still waiting to hear the beautiful moments of him entering into the monster world for visit!
You said that Thousand Plan is a spy sent by the monsters! Great! Let me go kill him right away...  Huh? He has lost his power and doesn't even have the energy to fight back? Fine! I don't kill the weak but I must at least give him some punishments!
Wow! You little guy are one of a kind! You can defeat the evil ancestor of the vampire. Come come come! I must burn some yellow papers and sworn with you.
Van Helsing is...  Sigh! How do I face him ever again? I am a Royal Knight who's goal is to destroy the monsters, how can I compromise with monsters? But Van Helsing...
Arrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr-- it's harder and harder to endure -- arrrrrrrr
Arrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr--
I feel the body is very weird, especially the wound. I feel the pain every now and then.
Can't believe Van Helsing just attack me!   I don't believe it! He's disappeared for that long and we haven't seen each other for that long, there's no reason for him to treat me like this!
Oh! You look quite fine. Have you hunted any monster yet?
Why do you come here little one? Don't waste time. Hurry up and go back to train up yourself! We do need a lot of elites to fight against the monsters and defeat the king of monster.
Basic Conversation with Maximilian
Young fighter, thank you for everything that you've done for us.  Salute!
Van Helsing is fine? Great   Please tell him that we actually look forward to his return and the past has passed, tell him to never put the hard feeling in his heart.
Although Thousand Plan admitted that he belongs to the monsters, but he also has a certain status in the human society. Before we have more solid evidence, we best not to do anything.  Just by hearing what you say is really hard to persuade the rest of the people, so we must collect more evidence to prove his evil acts. Also, there are many monsters believers, so if we act without thinking more carefully, it would lead to serious consequence!
Thank you for taking away a scary being from the humanity. I believed the monster world is very shocked by this and we have damaged their morale!    We have to keep this up and fight toward the capital of the monster, thoroughly destroy the whole monster gang - too bad that human constantly doubt each other and making it impossible for people to truly trust one another. What a loss!
Van Helsing is the son of Cane the King of the Vampires?... I'm very shocked by this!   But regardless, he's always the brave and righteous hero! I will forever respect him!
Arrrrrrrr--huh! No! I can't be controlled by the devils, I have to be conscious and awake!    I am a man, I am a righteous Royal Knight who destroys the evils! Arrrrrrrr! ArrrrrArrrr--
Are you okay?
Is this a greeting?
I am fine, you go further away... Don't get close to me... The poison of in my body... Starts to have effect  Hurry up and kill me! I don't want to become a monster that will harm others... Argh! Arrrrr--
Don't be like this!
I know a way to save you!
Your kindness of woman will harm others, hurry up! Arrrrrrrrr --
Stop! Stop! I forbid you to go find <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Thousand Plan</FONT>! I'd rather die than to find that little bastard! He slandered Van Helsing... And he bad mouth him... Also our purpose as Royal Knights is to destroy the monster and protect righteousness... We will never compromise with the monsters! So what the monster religious? Huh! Screw living in peace! It's a total cover up and I'm sure they do not have good intentions!... Arrrrr, arrr, arrrr--
Then I don't care~
I have to save you.
I bet you can't do it. Just leave me, hurry up and go... Arrrr...
Don't go find <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Thousand Plan</FONT>... Arrrrrarararararrarrrrrrr--
Go away! arrrarrrrrrrrr
Uhhhhhhh... I don't believe that I have mistaken him... Van Helsing must have his reasons behind.
Van Helsing... How come he has become like this... Uhhhhh waaa! (vomits blood) everyone is fine right?...  Van Helsing has disappeared many years, I thought he is dead... But he has actually returned... No! I don't believe it, it's impossible that he would lower his head to the evil!...
Friend, what brings you here?
Child, what brings you here?

Sigh! Arirang, where did you go?
Sigh! Arirang, why are you so stupid? Why did you give away your life and fortune because of a woman?
Aiya! arrrr this is great, that very great knight Satsuma Night, I hear rumors that they have conflicts with their own people! I think 80% is because someone didn't succeed in getting love, haha!   Also! The very famous vampire expert in our city always goes out at night and he always secretly eat the pig blood cake... His action is very similar to the monster's! you think he wants to go to the monsters too? Haha!

Basic Conversation with Hybrid Ghost Qing Liang
Don't know what sister will think after she knows of this bad news
Hi ~ you look so lifeless, what brings you to me?
Do you know the Yaos?
I am just passing by
Of course I know them! They are my childhood friend when I was little so we are family friends! The relationship between both our family has always been great!   We used to go to the field to have camp fire and observe the firefly during summer, we used to go skiing in the Sliver Bone... Oh by the way, what is it that you asked about them?
They died!
No, nothing!
What! You say that again! Did I hear wrongly! ? Oh my God... I think they must have been harmed by the people in the village. They were so kind, how can they just leave the world this way?...  It's you! You murderer, see how I'm going to revenge for them! Watch!
Hold on! Listen to me.
I'm going to go first.
Sigh... Now I see, but having the name of Dead Spirit Knight when they died is too heavy. I think as thing progressed, they were forced into it! But I must say the only thing that I'm glad is that they came across with people like you who worked the hardest for them. I think there's no regret in their hearts when they died!    My sister <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Qing Xin</FONT> is very good friends with them. I think no matter how cruel this is, he should know the whole story! But she is now in <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Leiguang grassland</FONT> to spread the gospel. Do you mind going there to tell her about this?
Sorry not on the way.
Alright, I'll go then!
<font COLOR=#00ff00>Leiguang Grassland</FONT> It's not very far away from there, I believed you should be able to find my sister very soon <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Qing Xin</FONT> will you think about this?
Then thank you for taking up this, I think Qing Xin should be in <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Leiguang Grassland</FONT>'s <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>south</FONT> I remember there was a <FONT COLOR=#ffad5b>wooden bridge</FONT> she should be rest nearby at this time, you can go there and look.
Hey! you murderer! I dare you not run!
Oh~i don't know if they are living fine now, if you pass <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Leiguang waterfall</FONT> Please help me spy on them!
Oh yea! then are you interested in joining us the monster spirit religion? We offer good benefits!
It's very hard for us the mixed breed to live on this planet, we always attract prejudice from the people, that's why we've always lived in the outskirt. I heard that the one who is living in <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Leiguang water</FONT>'s <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Yao-chun moon</FONT>, <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Yao-chun star</FONT> because the brother and sister weren't willing to leave, it triggered the anger of the villagers but they did nothing wrong! How strange!!! Just because we are mixed breed of the human and monster?   It's not fair! Sigh癒瓊I don't know if they are living fine, but if you pass <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Leiguang Water</FONT> Please help me visit them!
Basic Conversation with Hybrid Ghost - Joy Parker
<font COLOR=#00ff00>Monster spirit religion</FONT> a organization that tries its hardest to construct peace around the world. We promote to destroy the discrimination exists between different groups, taking away the prejudice between human and monsters, persuading both parties not to attack each other because of benefits...
Did you really write this flyer?
It sounds very cool!
Heheheh~of course not! I'd be glad if I'm actually that good. But I really admire the teaching of the Ogre Spirit religion, so when I have time I always recite these articles and try my best to act according to the teaching, which I believe can better bring peace around the word. So I'm just trying the best in my part!
I really don't believe in this!
It sounds quite good!
Please don't say bad things about <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Monster spirit religion</FONT> Alright? Do you wish to see endless fighting between man and monster? Even fight between the four civilizations? Is it wrong to hope for peace? I don't want to speak to someone who doesn't understand, you go now!
Huh! You think it's great too! I believed as long as everyone live peacefully with each other, we can bring more hopes to the world. Any conflicts can be solved with effective communication! Huh... Aw ~damn! Too bad I still haven't fully understood the teaching of the religion and makes me speechless... (blush)   Right, I heard that one of the three great figures in our monster spirit religion, called <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>癒ythe second greatest in monster spirit religion癒z</FONT>'s <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Hidden Blade</FONT> is in <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Leiguang Temple</FONT> for a lesson, you can go attend the lesson!
What a coincident!
I have to do something...
Yes~you are very lucky! Mr. Hidden Blade rarely reveals his schedule! It's an honor to see him and listen to him teach! I think after you attend the lesson you'll agree with us about the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>monster spirit religion</FONT>.  Oh right, my business here hasn't ended yet, since you have to go to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Leiguang Temple</FONT> to attend the lesson, then please also help me to pass <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>this entering list</FONT> to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Mr. Hidden Blade</FONT>, It took me great effort to obtain the information on this list, so don't lose it, you have to make sure it gets delivered <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>to Mr. Hidden Blade</FONT>'s hand! Heheheh癒瓊I believed <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Mr. Hidden Blade</FONT> will be very happy!
Please pass this <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>church member list</FONT> to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Hidden Blade</FONT>! I will come right away as I finish my business here! See you in the class! Heheh~
Eh? Why is your bag so full? Tidy it up!
Argh! What a shame~ Hidden Blade hardly exposes his schedule! Seeing him is a rare chance already, not to mention attending his lesson!
Oh! Don't be so biased. Our <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Ogre Spirit Society</FONT> is for peace!
Oh? Is there anything? Heheh! Okay~ I would love to talk to you too. But I don't have time now...
Do you need my help?
Oh, I'm leaving then!
Uhhhh... It's so nice of you! Oh no, excuse me! Cough. Actually I am going to Thunder Grassland for preaching, for our peace-loving <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Ogre Spirit Society</FONT>. There is not even a soul here, but <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>chimeras</FONT> made a fool of me. They took away my <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>preaching flyers</FONT>!   Uhhhhhh... They knew that a weak girl like me couldn't defend for myself. If my brother <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Goodfoot</FONT> working in <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Holt Plateau</FONT> can be here to protect me, they wouldn't be able to tease me! I'm so angry!
I'll help you!
You have a bad temper, girl.
Uhhhhh... I'm so touched! I know you are fast, you must be able to find back the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>10 Lost Flyers</FONT> for me!
Aw, I've got a stomach ache!
Well~ Needless to Say~
What~ What's wrong? Don't make up such a bad excuse!
Oh? Are you sure? Please come back in ten minutes! Haha, it was a joke. I dare not to ask for this. However, please be careful of the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>chimeras</FONT>. I guess they were just trying to have fun with me. Just stun them and get back my flyers! Or you will kill them! It will violate the rules of our religion, I would be very upset!
Huh! I don't need you~ What have I done to deserve this~ What? It's okay if you don't help me. Stop talking. I don't want to listen!
Uhhhh... You are so cruel! Why don't you ask me why I am busy? Do you want a shy girl like me to beg you?
Aw~ It's too bad! The hateful <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>chimeras</FONT> made a fool of me. They took away my <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>preaching flyers</FONT>!   Uhhhhhh... They knew that a weak girl like me couldn't defend for myself. If my brother <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Goodfoot</FONT> working in <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Holt Plateau</FONT> can be here to protect me, they wouldn't be able to tease me! I'm so angry!
Basic Conversation with Ghost Party Vice Head Trainer - Hidden Blade
I am having this lesson at such a remote location, because our <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Ogre Spirit Society</FONT> is not only for peace; we also help the hybrids rejected by the four civilizations.  They usually hide themselves up and live on their own. But their lives are poor, so our <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Ogre Spirit Society</FONT> is offering them some help. We are giving them charity aid kits on regular basis, hoping to give them some warmth.
Oh, I see.
Do you need my help?
If you have any other better suggestions, feel free to bring them up during my lesson!
Oh! If you mean to do that, you are certainly welcome! Do you se this deserted mansion next to us? They call it <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>The Ruined Mansion</FONT>. It was built by a rich man, who was attacked during the dark time; and then one night the entire family was gone.  The mansion gradually became chaotic and mysterious. But <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>The Ruined Mansion</FONT> is the best haven for hybrids rejected by the four civilizations. I heard that it lives many ghosts and monsters, but hybrids live peacefully with them. Quite a few persons on the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Church Member List</FONT> live inside. Can you send them <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>five charity aid kits</FONT> ?
Alright!
I don't have time~
You must have at least five units of space to carry the five charity aid kits. Please clear up for some space. Thank you.
Then I am not going to bother you.
Are you coming for the listen? Please register at the side desk!

You must be the savior of the new world, the follower of the four sacred men! Keep it up!
Alas~ Being part of the society, I understand others may spread rumors to attack us. I feel bad! But for world peace I will overcome it!
I heard that you braced up Justin. You are great!
I heard that you braced up Justin. You are great!
Justin wants to ask for your help. It seems like he has started to trust you. Please keep it up!
What? Justin pulled himself back together? I felt sorry for his upset face! Hope drinking some beet wine will cheer him up!!
Oh! A lot better~
I don't think so!
That's great! You can be a friend that he trusts! I think something else is bothering him...! Do you know? Go chat with him. I think he will pour it out to you.
Really? You don't have much faith on him! Well then let's help him!
Thanks for your endeavor for peace. Good man~ You are such a good man, so you must be willing to help solving tiny problems!
I'm willing (seriously)
Now I want to be a bad man
I heard that science researcher Justin is a genius! But Science Head Edison doesn't like him very much. Moreover... For this you'd better ask him!
I am going then!
I won't go~
Oh do your best! By the way, I have a bottle of <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Beet Wine</FONT>. Bring some to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Justin</FONT>, as a gift to cheer him up!
<font COLOR=#00ff00>Justin</FONT> is very introverted. I think should be somewhere near <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Spiritual Land</FONT>! Find him there. Thank you~
Your bag is full! Do you want to clear it up, or buy a few Books of Bag Expansion in the town?
Oh! It's so mean of you! Go ask him if you really want to know!
Aw~ Be open-minded! Being able to help is bliss!
Hey! Here you are again~ The reward of the previous mission? Sorry, I left it at home. I am sending someone to take it now. But before now, can you do me one more favor, go to the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Thunder Hill</FONT> for me? Please!
I'm good. I promise you!
No way~
You are such a good man! In that case, may I ask you to do this favor? This is <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Soul Powder</FONT>. It is used to calming and soothing one's soul, perfect for those who have to concentrate on work.  Now please take this good thing to our preacher in <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Thunder Hill</FONT>, <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Burnt Land</FONT>. Go right away! I will be waiting here for you.
No~please promise me!
Hey! The weather is so fine today!   You look very upset. What's wrong? Feel free to tell me if you are unhappy! Our Ogre Spirit Society is best at resolving problems!
I don't have the mood for that
Do you know Knight Dullahan?
Oh! It doesn't matter. I will be here for you whenever you need!
Oh! Knight Dullahan? The cruel, heartless monster? Of course I know about him! But I think you have overreacted! Just like animals! If we don't attack them, they won't attack us.   Speaking of which, do you know about <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>The Light family</FONT> ? If you don't, you can go to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Thunder Hill</FONT> and find Cultural Retired Senior, <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Limei</FONT>, to get the full story! I think the people back then overreacted. They attacked the grandfather of Light as he became a ghost. Of course he had to defend! Poor grandfather was eliminated and cursed for so many years. Even his offspring suffers.   I think those initiated the fight should be blamed. What do you think?
But a ghost is a ghost!
You are quite right!
What? After all you are just like others, thinking that ghosts must be bad and should be killed? Leave now. We have nothing to talk about!
Yes! Who says ghosts are all bad, mortals are all right? Poor Light siblings are innocent, but they still loathe them no matter how good-natured they are.  Not only did they attack the then-Knight Dullahan, Day Light, but also the remaining brother and sister. Poor children!
Why can I help them?
Stop it!
Really? It is so great of you! That would be great if everyone is just like you! There are many people who don't believe in our Ogre Spirit Society. They think we are bad! Sometimes it really frustrates me.  But you take the initiative to help us, I am faithful again. Therefore, may I ask you for a favor?
Let me think!
Certainly~
It seems like you are still doubtful about us! Forget it. I won't force you. Come back again if you want!
Great! Here I have two gifts for people from <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Mainstream</FONT> and <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Science</FONT>, to show our friendliness.  The first one is for <FONT COLOR=#ffad5b> The Most Beautiful Mainstream Saint Knight</FONT> <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Dancing Willow</FONT>. this bottle of <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Youth Water</FONT> is perfect for skincare, she will like it. <font COLOR=#00ff00>Dancing Willow</FONT> lives <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>behind the square</FONT>. But she is always out for mission. Please pass it to her sister <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Dancing Queen</FONT>, thank you!
I will be waiting here for you~
Your bag is full! Do you want to clear it up, or buy a few Books of Bag Expansion in the town?
What is wrong? Just like mortals, there are good and bad hybrids. Even a good man has his own bad side.  Therefore you must approach them and understand them; not being biased to think that they are bad. This is wrong!
Ghosts are not as terrible as you think! They are kind and lovely!   We don't hate them because they look different. It is unfair! So do you want to join our Ogre Spirit Society to change this cliched thought?
Basic Conversation with Dancing Queen Villager of Holy Crater
Uhhhh... Sister is not coming back, is her? Please can you ask San Roco to let her go?
Uhhhh... Arthur took my sister away... Please can you save her?
Ah~ Thank you so much for your help! Otherwise my sister would give me a lecture.  Let me say: Thank you! Thanks, thanks, thanks!
See how lovely I am! Perhaps I will grow to be as beautiful as my sister Dancing Willow! Heheh~
Basic Conversation with Potionmaster Hengery
Huhhuh! The women like my gifts? I still have loads here!
You bastard! Tell me! How much did the ghosts pay you to give me the poisonous potion?   Uh! I was befuddled by money. I lost my sanity for just little advantages. I am such a sinner! And you... As a human you team up with the evil to harm us! The Ogre Spirit Society is evil! It was a plan to set me up, right?
Here is the story!
Please listen to me~
How dare you to smile? You are shameless. God! How could I be so stupid to be fooled by you? I am so regretful --------
I won't listen to you! Get away now, or I will bite you!   How do you want to explain why you betrayed us? Or are you trying to tell me you were a fool to be cheated by those girls screaming 'Oh, peace! Oh, love!'?
Who are you talking about?
That's right!
Stop playing the idiot! There is just one girl who calls herself the 'Peace ambassador' from the Ogre Spirit Society in Holy Crater. I will call the police to catch you all!
Shut up! Stay here if you have guts. I am getting the Holy Crater security team to catch you! As well as the evil girls! She must have the remedy, I must force her to give me.  Oh! It is my 'reward' to her. Give it to her now! Quick--
I know!
I reject!
Give it to the girl, and you'd better not shrug away--
If your bag is full, you'd better clear it up now! Quick--
You evil boy! I will not forgive you--
Argh! Here you are! Let me ask you. What on earth is the potion that you gave me? It has driven lots of customers back. But those who come back to buy are excited, but their eyes are hollow, but they giggle sometimes.  God! Is it a contraband? I love money, but I don't do immoral business! Perhaps I should send the potion for a check.
Are you tired? Here is a potion! It's energizing!
Basic Conversation with Science Researcher Justin
It's strange. I remember something good happened! But I don't remember what it is! Hey, do you know why I am so happy lately?
If I have fame, wealth will follow. People will be envious of me, the most influential figure in science. Then Dancing Willow will notice me...  Every time I think up to this point I can't help but feel flattered...
You are great!
You are a betrayer!
Haha! Not everyone is as intelligent and brave as I am. On the day when my plan comes successful, I will have both fame and wealth. Haha!
It is not as bad as you say! I am just pursuing my success. The old moron Edison is jealous of my talent. He meant to suppress my success. I loathe him for so long! With my talent I deserve a better job and title.  My innovation and concept are great. The School President Bacherikov thinks highly of me, but a majority of the work is still managed by Edison. I will never have a chance to stand out. How can I give myself up?  Right! I used you to give Edison the poisonous fake note, and stole a lot of confidential information from his room when he passed out and you were away to obtain materials. He made me do this!
Wake up before it is too late!
Stop your lame arguments!
Are you kidding? I have been working so hard for years, but no one paid attention to me. And the Ogre Spirit Society has everything I need. Mortals are selfish, I will just pick the advantageous side.  I dared not to carry out this plan, but after I had the drink Hengery gave me, I found my courage to think for myself... After the day I had your beet wine, I decided to protect my own advantages.  No! I will not regret. Bacherikov and the others should apologize to me. Edison made me do this! I did nothing wrong! I will be a science leader, and get the love of Dancing Willow, and become the king of the world!
That's understandable!
You are so selfish!
Of course! If you have such a chance, I am sure if you would give up on the hypocrites and choose the right way!
Say whatever you like! I have already submitted the confidential information anyway! Blame Edison! For his blindness and selfishness! He caused all these consequences!
Say whatever you like! Those whom no one is jealous of are stupid. An ordinary man like you will never understand how I feel. Huh! I don't want to waste my time talking to you! I have a lot to do!
Haha! I didn't expect that I could do Edison a favor. That is great! People will look up to me, I will be famous. Everyone will know my name 'Justin'!
Did you give this <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>notebook</FONT> to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Edison</FONT> ? Haha! From now on he must be hiding inside the lab. It's my perfect chance... Hey! Where are you? According to my estimation, he should ask you to get something! Move now!
It is not fair! My results and intelligence are all better than Walgoskov. But Edison adores on him, that's why he easily got the new position as a Newbie's Supervisor!
Basic Conversation with Uncle Kasha
Dancing Willow makes me worried.
Kid, you seem busy lately~ How are you doing?
Don't worry, I will take this Tooth Necklace to Dancing Queen. Finish your work!
Kid, this place is dangerous! Don't come too close if you are not powerful enough!
Basic Conversation with Spirit School Head Engineer - Edison
Bacherikov gave Justin some medicine to control his insanity. But it cannot cure him completely... Alas! What do you think we should do?
Justin's situation is getting worse. I have reported this to President Bacherikov. He told us to observe his situation. We have sent someone to spy on Justin!
Justin is getting too far. But a fault confessed is half redressed! Please help me convince me!
Thank you for your unconditional offer of this great invention. If this machine can really produce something, we will never forget you!   I know that Mainstream's <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>San Roco</FONT> is concerned about the progress of the machine. He must be very happy if he knows about this. <font COLOR=#00ff00>San Roco</FONT> lives near the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Holy Plain</FONT>. Please go to tell him!
Please hold on! God! I almost missed a talent. Tell me if you wrote all the information in the notebook?
I don't know. What notebook?
Do you like it?
Eh? (looking up and down)   You gave me this notebook, right? Am I talking to a wrong guy? No... I am still sober.
Not just like. It is marvelous! According to the notebook, once I get <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Frozen Stone</FONT> from <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Instantly Frozen Pumpkin</FONT>, <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Mad Motor Core</FONT> inside <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Machine Crusher Franken</FONT>, and the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Regretful Heart</FONT> of <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Mummy King</FONT>, I can create the key energy for the Spiritual Power Purifier.  but this theory is too complicated! As the Mad Motor Core is spinning, it generate electricity and heat, which with the temperature of Frozen Stone, will decrease to a normal level; then the evil power of Regretful Heart will transform the ionization...   If I can create this machine, world peace will have a ray of hope! I can't wait to try! But these three items are hard to obtain, and I must stay here. What should I do?
I will finish it!
Don't bother me~
I know you are clever and brave, young man! But these three kinds of monsters are hard to defeat, watch out. They show up around <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Corpse Church BF1</FONT>, which is very stiff. Leave right away as you get the items. Don't continue the fight!
Suddenly I don't want to go~
Count on me!
... No problem. It is indeed quite hard. If you dare not, let's just forget it.   I will do some research and see if I can find other alternatives.
I depend on you now! I have to go back to the Holy Crater laboratory to study the notes, and enhance the power and stability of the machine! I will have to stay inside the laboratory for a long while!
You gave me the notebook because you want to see this machine created right? Why are you turning me down now?  I know it! You are not capable of getting all the three items! Never mind, I will find another way out.
The spirit of science is about evidence. I'm sure you will agree!
Basic Conversation with Purple Knight Major - San Roco
Thanks for helping us. I appreciate it.   Dancing Willow was too careless. Alas!
I have told Edison about your story. Sorry that I mistook you.
God! Bastard! How could it happen?
Should I just leave?
What happened?
Bastard! Stay away from me --- Or I will catch you as a betrayer!
Are you a spy? You have been asking around Holy Crater. I am sure you are a betrayer!
Prove it~
I am leaving! Bye!
If I can prove it can you still be here? God! You are human, too! How can you work for the ghosts to harm human? Our Holy Crater and Thunder Hill security teams are finally work together to eliminate the ghosts...  But someone betrayed us and spread our military secrets to the ghosts... We have planned it for so long, now it's all in vain!    According to my investigation, you are the only one often being in touch with important personages in Holy Crater!
I am innocent!
Lies!
You cannot deny it! You gave Edison a fake notebook and bewitched him. When he was too occupied, you took away his confidential information!   You colluded with the ghosts to get the three items swiftly! And then you sneaked into his laboratory. Am I right? God? We were dump bells to think that you are brave and ardent. I even expected you to finish the Sealed Book and become the Fourth Saint...  We were too naive... We hoped you could seal all the ghosts and finish the Sealed Book, and be the world's savior. I am sure <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Edison</FONT> had the same hope too. But you... To prove that you are innocent, go find him to clarify everything! I will wait here.
You want to deny it? Admit it! Admit that you are the betrayer! Be brave to face your sins! Don't be a coward.  Whether you admit it or not, you are already the public enemy! No matter where you go, you won't get away easily!
Don't run! Do you think you can escape? I will definitely make you admit it!
When can we lead a fearless and peaceful life?
Basic Conversation with Ghost Party Thunder Hill Messenger - Johnson

Stop your R sound~
I am good, I promise you!
Alas! Are you really not willing to? Please be generous!
You are such a good man! I know I can count on you! Great! Here I have another gift. Please take it to the opposite <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Holy Crater</FONT> and give it to our members, the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Missing Perfume</FONT> sisters.  Don't belittle this bottle of <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Holy Waterrrr</FONT>, it is extremely powerful to revive human cells and energize someone. It is good for thinkers and physical trainers!   I think the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Missing Perfume</FONT> sisters need this <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Holy Waterrrr</FONT>. Thank you! I will wait for you here!
I am asking you to deliver things for me again. But your bag is full! Do you want to clear it up, or buy a few <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Books of Bag Expansion</FONT> ? With it your bag can carry as much as you want!
What's wrong? Why are you so upset? Is it for the conflicts between mortals and ghosts? Feel free to tell me, our Ogre Spirit Society is best at resolving problems.
Do you know Knight Dullahan?
No time for that!
Knight Dullahan? Of course I know about him! The one who made the mortals panicky! But I think the people back then overreacted. They attacked the eldest son of Light as he became a ghost. Of course he had to defend!   The people! They didn't just attack the eldest son Day Light after he became Knight Dullahan, they even attacked his siblings. I felt so bad for them, but I couldn't save them in time. I am still very unhappy for it.   Speaking of which, do you know about <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>The Light family</FONT> ? If you don't, you can go to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Thunder Hill</FONT> and find Cultural Retired Senior, <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Limei</FONT>, to get the full story!
I want to help them!
I don't understand!
Ohoh! Not many people are as active as you. It's rare! Perhaps we can be friends! There are many people in the village who don't believe in our Ogre Spirit Society. They think we are bad! Sometimes it really frustrates me.  But you take the initiative to help us, I am faithful again. Therefore, may I ask you for a favor?
Let me think!
I will do my best!
Eh? Have you not decided to help me? Why are you turning me down?   Forget it. I won't force you. Come back again if you want!
Great! Here I have two gifts for people from Nature and Cult, to show our friendliness.  The first one is for <FONT COLOR=#ffad5b> <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Kosouro</FONT> from <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Cult</FONT>.  This is a handbook called <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Vessel Map</FONT>. It was discovered by someone accidentally during his training. Train according to the method described in the map will speed up the progress. I am sure people in Cult will be very interested.
Sending them now!
Ugh... I got a stomach ache.
But <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Kousouro</FONT> is always away from home. But I know that he must pass by <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Wizard's Cave</FONT>. Please go there to find him. Thank you!
Your bag is full! Do you want to clear it up, or buy a few Books of Bag Expansion in the town? Otherwise I cannot give you anything.
Oh~ There is a grassland nearby. Get there to relax now. I will wait for you here~
What is wrong? Just like mortals, there are good and bad hybrids. Even a good man has his own bad side.  Therefore you must approach them and understand them; not being biased to think that they are bad. This is wrong!
It's alright that you don't have the mood now. But remember I will be here whenever you want to talk!
My whole life is given to peace.  Just like mortals, there are good and bad ghosts. We should be objective, not biased and hostile.

Who are you? Why are you here to interrupt my training? I am not like you, wanderer. Have you heard of the story of diligent ants and lazy crickets?
Basic Conversation with Myan
I heard that my sister-in-law discovered the conspiracy of the Ogre Spirit Society, and saved all the villagers in Holy Crater. And you helped a lot! I know her temper. That's so great of you!
Young Valiant! Do you want to join our security team? You can find our <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Vice Major Seroka</FONT>, he will arrange for you. But he is now in <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Spiritual Land</FONT> for a mission. You can go there to find him.  This time, thank you so much. If you want to find <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Seroka</FONT>, run towards <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Spiritual Land</FONT>! We have to leave now!
Jesim! My lovely Jesim, how are you?
The child is petrified~
The child seems soulless~
Really? Jesim, Jesim? Don't scare mummy!  Are you not feeling well? Tell mum. Uhhhh... Why are you hollow-eyed and speechless? Uhhhh...
Soulless? What does this mean? We are one of the Cult civilization. We don't understand, please make it clear.  Uhh, I shouldn't have brought her to this place. Thunder Hill is such a weird place... We were escorted to this place. The journey was smooth and safe. But as we arrived in Thunder Hill, a Magical Mirror appeared and casted a glow on Jesim's face. Fortunately Mirat broke it in time.  I thought she was fine. But as we came to here, she suddenly stood still, emotionless... What is wrong? Is it because they don't welcome us?    God, I must ask my sister-in-law Kishira to here to do Jesim some justice!
Try to give her a slap?
It's because of the ghosts!
What are you blabbering about? Why are you making a fool of me now? Go away, don't bother me.
It was just a mirror. How could this happen? I heard that Cult is not a righteous civilization. There is a terrible thing called <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Magical Mirror</FONT>. I heard that this <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Magical Mirror</FONT> confines human souls...  Argh! My daughter must be injured by that devil! What should I do? I don't know where to find that <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Magical Mirror</FONT>! Young man, can you help me? Find my daughter's soul.
Count on me!
I'm afraid...
Oh! I don't know how to express my gratitude. But this <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Magical Mirror</FONT> is fast. It disappears in a flash. Uhhh... What should I do? I should have listened to my husband; I should not come to Thunder Hill.  Right! When I first got here, I saw a weird old woman. When she looked at Jesim she told me to beware. Perhaps she knows something, or perhaps it's her who released the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Magical Mirror</FONT>. That old woman is near the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>entrance</FONT>. I heard the passing by villagers called her <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Cacha</FONT>.  Even if it was not her who released the Magical Mirror, she must know something. Please help me to ask her. Thank you!
... You are a valiant! Helping the weak and punishing the evil is your duty! How can you say this?
Thunder Hill looks so different from our Holy Crater! We can come here for a short stay every now and then, just to have some fresh air and unpolluted apples.

Uh! Mum, Mum... Jesim is scared!

Wow! It's strange! This house is made of wood and mushrooms!

Uhuh, young man, uhuh, do you feel, uhuh, the joy of helping others? Heheh.
Uhuh, welcome, welcome, welcome, uhuh, welcome to Thunder Hill! We have beautiful scenery, uhuh, and fresh air. You will like it. Hehe!
Basic Conversation with Seroka
I heard that Kishira discovered the conspiracy of the Ogre Spirit Society, and saved all the villagers in Holy Crater. And you helped a lot! I know her temper. That's so great of you!   My eyes? Don't worry. I can see now! Not very clear though. But I am optimistic! Hahaha.
By the way, you said the guy who pretended to be Roje was sealed by you in the Aired Field. But I am still worried. This issue could be a big conspiracy. During the time I cure my eyes, you try to ask something out of him!
My eyes... Alas!
Hey! Good morning
I am here to confess
What are you doing here? Get away! It pisses me off to see you.
You? Why is it you again? I don't want to see you. Leave now!
Can't you see me!
I am leaving right now
You...  Alas! You are right! I am useless! I can't even recognize who it is in front of me...
I will cure you
Argh~ Sorry
What an easy talk! My eyes were hurt by the poisonous pieces of Aires crystal. It is incurable! Forget it! I know you were being used, or you wouldn't come here for me. But you'd better leave!
I will find a doctor for you
I am going now!
It's useless. Cases like mine are incurable! Though it is very embarrassing to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Erika</FONT>, but there is nothing I can do.  Who is <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Erika</FONT> ? He is the Medical Master in Spirit School. He knows every illness. But this is a rare chance that he hosts a lesson in Holy Crater, I don't want to bother him. My situation is critical, I don't think he can do anything for me!   If you are not feeling well, find him. I think now he should be in <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>the north-eastern part of Aired Field</FONT> pondering something!
Okay! Mind your own business and carry on your ordinary life!
... Forget it! I have been too impulsive, and have hurt so many people. This is a punishment from God, for my arrogance! Haha!
Go away and don't come back ever again! Now!
Get your stuff and run, don't disturb me!   Also! The crying Rosh is very annoying. Go to comfort her and ask her to go back to Holy Crater! It's too dangerous for a girl to be here. She will be our burden!
Huh! What a hypocrite! You are lucky! But the Werewolf is so weak now, you will just win anytime. But I don't have time to handle it. Don't be arrogant because of this!
Ah? Did you say you want to join the army? You look so weak, I'm afraid you cannot make it. We are looking for brave fighters to fight with the demons. You don't seem who we are after!
You look down on me!
Give me a mission!
I do look down on you, so what? If there is nothing else, get away. Stop wasting my time!
I am very busy, where comes the time to mind your business? If you have nothing to do, <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Rafa the pub waitress</FONT> was attacked by a ghost last night. If you have guts, go to help her!   She lives in <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>the eastern part of Stone Temple Plateau</FONT> Go help her if you want!
I am going now!
Ah? What is it?
Ha! I was just joking! Okay, if you want to kill yourself, I will not stop you. But let me warn you, if you cannot save her, tell me right away before she turns into a ghost!   She lives in <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>the eastern part of Stone Temple Plateau</FONT>. You want to prove yourself? Go help her!
Huh! What? Scared? Then get away. I knew that you are unpromising.
Hey, what are you doing here? It is not a place you should come. Leave now!
Basic Conversation with Foka
Young boy, are you here to ask me about the nature of Werewolf?
Werewolf are a kind of special animals. They have their own hierarchy and system. Human hurt by a Werewolf will become one of them! Do you know that?
Basic Conversation with Rosh
Uhhhhhhh... Dad, don't leave Rosh alone! If you love Rosh, why do you leave me alone...
Have you found dad?
Sorry, I cannot help you!
Well... I...
Is... Dad just leaving Rosh forever like mum?
Did you see dad? That's wonderful! Rosh is very happy. Seroka deserves what he suffered!
Eh~ How is he?
This child is vicious!
I heard from the knights passing by that he was studying a strange crystal; but the crystal exploded and blinded him!   I don't know anything about that crystal, but a bad guy like Seroka deserves it. But... I am wondering how bad he got hurt. Can you pay him a visit?
No!
I will go!
Right! Ignore this kind of bad man.
Seroka is hateful, but I still hope he is well. When you have time, please pay him a visit.
Get away! Why do I have to have mercy on him? Huh!
Dad... Uhhh! Where are you? Rosh misses you!
Girl, why are you crying?
Girl, you are every noisy!
Uh... My dad is a samurai. He is very powerful. Every time he is sent to do a dangerous mission, he can always come home swiftly to be with Rosh. But this time he has been away for a long time, so I have come all the way to here to find me. But the ghost standing ahead is very powerful, I dare not to go.   My guardian asked the commissioner <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Seroka</FONT>. He said Samurais are bad, they are doomed to fail. He said my dad died for glory!    Uhhh... No! Rosh wants dad home. Please help me find my dad. Please help me. He is just right there. But Rosh cannot go, uhhhh...
How can I help you?
Wait several more days
Uhh! Dad told Rosh that he was going to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Aired Field</FONT> to beat the monsters. He said the mission was tough, but he would come home safe. But... But... Uhhh...  Rosh hates <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Seroka</FONT>! He sent dad to that place. He cursed Dad. I loathe him... But he must know where Dad is!
Let me ask!
Don't want to talk...
Uhh~ Please help Rosh to find dad. <font COLOR=#00ff00>Seroka</FONT>, he must know where he is. But he has left for <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Spiritual Land</FONT> for a mission. Can you go there, please?
Uhh~ Who can find Dad for Rosh?   Dad-----
But Rosh has been waiting for half a month already. Dad never leaves Rosh waiting for so long. Uhhhh...
Uhhhhh--  Dad has never left Rosh for so long... I'm scared! Uhhh... Uh!
Uhh, dad has been out for so long. I miss him! There are many ghosts and monsters ahead, I cannot move on!   Please help me find him, okay? I can give you my pig bank.
Basic Conversation with Roje
Huh! Enjoy your last drop of happiness! We are forming a strong power in Seal Tower and we are ready to go. Oh~ I slipped it out!
You idiot! Are you coming against me? But you're arrogant days are coming to an end, hahahaha... We have made an entire plan to catch off your guard!
Lies!
What is the plan?
What a joke! Let me tell you each and every one to prove that I am not lying!   We have an evil object called Magical Mirror, which captures human souls. Holy Crater and Thunder Hill are never on good terms; which is not a secret. Therefore as the people from Holy Crater go to Thunder Hill, we will send the Magical Mirror to capture the girl's soul. Then the people from Holy Crater must think that villagers do it and thus hate them more. Then we can incite them against each other and even a civil war! Hahaha!
You are wonderful
It was solved ages ago
Hahaha! What? Admire us? Watch out. I will come back.
What!!! You... You win. But never time. We have a lot of elites here. One failure means nothing! I have more terrible skills! Moreover our members hiding in the Holy Crater knows that the pub waitress goes to the grass to pick wine berries.  We convinced Seroka to send a Purple Knight to protect her, and then send a brutal Werewolf to attack her. The young girl is so popular in the city!    If everyone knows she is killed even with the protection of Purple Knight, will the villagers still trust them?
I have already cured her!
Oh! You are brilliant!
!!! You lie! I don't believe you! Liar!!! We will not fail. Don't lie to me! I talked you into giving the Aires Crystal to Seroka... What? He is still alive? How is it possible? The Aires Crystal is so powerful, the plan should be perfect. It should not fail!   ... I can't believe it. We spent such a long time planning, and you ruined it... God!... Now I can just admit it. But we still have another way out. Haha! The Aires Crystal is an explosive mineral, but recently many hell refiners are producing an even more explosive material. One little piece is enough to blow up an entire city.   We will use this material to create <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Crystal bombs</FONT> and send to the Holy Crater. We have the bomb installation control with us. We will surely win. You think you destroyed our plan? We still have an ace! Hahaha!
I don't care!
What is the ace?
How boastful! Seeing you are so confident, let me tell you the truth: actually the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Bomb Crystal</FONT> is within the body of <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Kishira, Purple Heart Knight Vice Major</FONT>! What do you think? Surprised, right? It looks like a simple crystal ball, but no one knows it can blow up a city! But Kishira is very suspicious. If you can get the Bomb Crystal from her, you win! Hahahahahaha...
Her? I'd better give up!
Huh! I will go find her now!
Hahahaha! What? Just give up. I am the only winner.
Good luck! Hahahaha--------
It's a joke! How can I tell you? Give up! Hahahaha...
Huh! Stop digging at us. We still have an ace. Go on, that is probably your last smile.
Huh! I am not an idiot! Why should I tell you? Figure it out yourself!   As you find the answer, the two towns will be gone! Hahahaha!
Devil! Let me go!
Friend! Are you taking the crystals to Seroka?
There are so many powerful ghosts ahead... But I must finish complete my mission! I promised Rosh I will go home safe!

Hello, we see each other again! Thank you very much last time. By the way, two days ago I passed by <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Stone Temple near the entrance of Aired Field</FONT>, I heard someone sobbing. The voice was like the girl living in the holy crater, <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Rosh</FONT>.  Did I make a mistake? Why would she go to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Aired Field</FONT> alone?

Basic Conversation with Lebalo, Oasis Villager, Mirage Oasis
You... You... ??? I don't know what you are talking about. I am not what <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Indie God</FONT>!  My name is Lebalo. My mother said it's the name of a renowned Ancient Egyptian Priest. We Egyptians worship Lebalo for his contributions! I think sharing a name with him is my honor!
What? Did I get it wrong? You want to kill me??? Hahahaha~~~ It's funny!  Let's see if you have the guts and power!  Come here to kill me, boy!  Wa~hahahaha~~~~
What~ I don't care!
I...
Oh~ Come with me, daredevil! ?  Okay... Let me show you how great I am!!!
Haha~ Scared?  Why pretending you are a valiant? A valiant will never be hesitant!
Oh? What did you say? No treasure?  I am telling the truth... That you cannot find it has nothing to do with me!
If you have got the Key of Treasure Box but still cannot get into the room~ the reason should be that you forgot to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>activate the Locked Room Switch Pillar</FONT>!!! It is in King Namu's room, a cement pillar with a symbol. Bring the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Key of Treasure Box</FONT> and touch it, then it will send you to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Mysterious Sanctuary</FONT>!  If you have <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>lost the Key of Treasure Box</FONT>, you must defeat <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>King Namu</FONT> again to get another <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Key of Treasure Box</FONT>! But now he is more cautious~ So it won't be that easy!
I think the soul of Alibella has revived already. Now you have taken her four Canopic jars, the chance of her revival is bigger!  Ah Well... Actually I have just thought of a way to repay you!  Hey, tell you a secret. Allegedly <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Mystique Pyramid</FONT> has an unknown <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>locked room</FONT> hiding lots of precious <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Phara's treasure</FONT>!  But you need to get the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Key of Treasure Box</FONT> from <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>King Namu</FONT> to get into this room! So if you are interested, it should be a great news to you!
Wow~ Treasure!
Money can't buy everything
Right~ Allegedly there are lots of treasures in it! If you are interested, let me tell you in detail!  First you have to go to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Mystique Pyramid</FONT>, and find <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>King Namu</FONT> and take his <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Key of Treasure Box</FONT>. With the Key of Key Box you can activate the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Locked Room Switch Pillar</FONT> of his room. Then you can get into the Locked Room - <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Mysterious Sanctuary</FONT>!
Haha~ You are too honest!! I told you this news~ but you are turning me down! ? Think it over! When you have made up your mind, I will tell you in detail.
If you have already out <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Protection spell of saint armor</FONT> into <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Life and Death Jar</FONT> but nothing happens, it is because you have not touched the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Life and Death Jar</FONT> again. Or you haven't found Alibella?
You must get the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Protection spell of saint armor</FONT> before you wake up the soul of <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Alibella</FONT>, giving her the chance to revive!  Therefore you have to defeat <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Anubis' spirit</FONT> or <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Anubis' soul</FONT> to get Matt's Feather, and put <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Matt's Feather</FONT> into <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Mysterious Treasure</FONT> to get the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Protection spell of saint armor</FONT>! Come back to me when you get it!
After obtaining the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Protection spell of saint armor</FONT>, please go to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Queen's Tomb</FONT> to find the coffin of <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Alibella</FONT>, and put the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Protection spell of saint armor</FONT> into the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Life and Death Jar</FONT> in front of the coffin to wake up <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Alibella</FONT>'s soul. And then she may come back to life! Are you willing to try?
Ok, I will go there~
I am really tired!
Thank you so much for your help! I think Alibella's coffin was left in some hidden corner... But you can identify it with the small <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Life and Death Jar</FONT> in front of it. Gently put the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Protection spell of saint armor</FONT> into the jar, and I will wake up the soul of Alibella!
It's tough... You must have been very exhausted now!  Take a rest, and come back to me after you rest up...
I am sure you can feel the power of the armor now! I am sure in this spiritual armor you can break into <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Mystique Pyramid</FONT> and save my lover... To tell you the truth, my lover, <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Alibella</FONT> is a poor Phara's wife. Her beauty aroused the jealousy of <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Cleopatra</FONT>. She sent someone to kill Alibella and announced that she died by accident...  According to the customs, after an Egyptian dies, his soul will go to the underworld guardian <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Anubis</FONT>, and have his heart weighted with <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Matt's Feather</FONT>. If his heart is lighter than <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Matt's Feather</FONT>, he will come back to life again. But the evil <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Cleopatra</FONT> joined force with <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Anubis</FONT> to add lead on the heart of <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Alibella</FONT>, and announced loudly that <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Alibella</FONT> could not revive! My poor <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Alibella</FONT>'s soul must be swallowed by the crocodile-head, lion-body, and hippo-leg monster Amit. Ah... It really breaks my heart!!! But now this is a chance to save the soul of <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Alibella</FONT>! It is to find <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Anubis</FONT> and get the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Matt's Feather</FONT>, and then we will be able to save her!  Now Anubis has divided into <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Anubis' spirit</FONT> and <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Anubis' soul</FONT>. Defeat any of them and you will get the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Matt's Feather</FONT>! Can you do me this favor?
I certainly will!
I'm just not capable of it!
Thank you so much... Valiant! Please remember, <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Anubus' Soul</FONT> and <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Anubus' Spirit</FONT> are in <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>the two sides of Mystique Pyramid Basement</FONT>. Just <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>get one Matt's Feather</FONT> for me! I will then tell you what to do next! Remember~ When you get a <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Matt's Feather</FONT> bring it back to me right away!!!
I am so disappointed... Young man~ Don't belittle yourself if you want to survive... Alright! If you truly lack the confidence, get some friends to help!
What should I do? What should I do? My lover is locked inside <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Mystique Pyramid</FONT>. I must get her out now!!! But <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Mystique Pyramid</FONT> is a cursed place, there are many ancient Egyptian guards, and one cannot get in without wearing <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>magical special armor</FONT>! The problem now is that, this kind of special armor is made of rare <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Tartarus Swords</FONT>, and Tartarus Swords are kept by the guards of Phara. Now only the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Guards of Dark Hell</FONT> in <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Death Valley</FONT> have them... But I am just an ordinary man and I don't have the power to journy into such a dangerous place. Can I ask you for this favor?! Please...
I can try to find it!
It's too dangerous!
Remember, Tartarus Swords are kept by <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Guards of Dark Hell in Death Valley</FONT>...  I need for you to retrieve <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>20 Tartarus Swords</FONT>! You are my only hope!!!
Be confident! Trust my judgement. You look like a fearless valiant! In this chaotic world, you must be something special in order to have made your way all the way here. Don't suppress your power! You can do it!
Ok, I will help you find it!
Find someone else!
Remember, Tartarus Swords are kept by <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Guards of Dark Hell in Death Valley</FONT>...  I need for you to retrieve <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>20 Tartarus Swords</FONT>! You are my only hope!!!
I am so disappointed... Young man~ Don't belittle yourself if you hope to survive... Alright! If you truly lack the confidence, get some friends to help!

Head out to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Mystique Pyramid Queen's Tomb</FONT>, find the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Demonic Fox of the Shadow Army</FONT> and ask him for what he is guarding. <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>The Wolf-shaped Jar</FONT>. That's it!
Okay. No problem.
I am really tired!

My soul may be safe, but I still have to find the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Canopic Jars</FONT> that contains my four organs. They are<font COLOR=#00ff00> the Monkey-Shaped Jar that contains my lungs, the Human-Shaped Jar that holds my liver, the Wolf-Shaped Jar that keeps my stomach, and the Hawk-Shaped Jar that contains my instestines.</font>. Casting a magic spell on all four jars will bring me back to life once again. <PF>Cleopatra was frightened that I might come back to life, so she made the guards in Mystique Pyramid to keep the four <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Canopic Jars</FONT> needed for my revival. Can you help me find my four <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Canopic Jars</FONT>?
That should be no problem!
I probably can't do that.
Then first, go outside and head for <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Mystique Pyramid Queen's Tomb</FONT>, and find <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>the Ancient Warrior</FONT>. He should be guarding <font COLOR=#00ff00>the Monkey-Shaped Jar</FONT>. Please bring it back to me!
What? Are you not here to help me? Please don't give up now!
So it's you who has awaken my soul! You say <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Lebalo</FONT> has told you to come for me? Thank you very much! Why am I trapped here, you ask? Oh~ that's because <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Cleopatra</FONT> was envious of my beauty. In order to avoid falling out of favor, she sent someone to kill me! After my death, the cruel <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Cleopatra</FONT> even joined forces with <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Anubis</FONT>, claiming that my heart was heavier than <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Matt's Feather</FONT>, thus leaving my soul in the swallowed state! Oh, how I loathe her~
I will avenge you!
Leave!
Wonderful! Now you just have to get to the level of <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Mystique Pyramid - Queen's Tomb</FONT> where you will find a large and mysterious room. There you will find <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Cleopatra</FONT>! I will wait here for your news!
I know that you are a fighter of justice, so you must help me! For my soul to be revived, all of this senseless damage and hurt must cease! The soul of Cleopatra is still inside of the Queen's Tomb. If she knows my soul has risen, she will certainly send guards of Dark Hell here to attack me, keeping me from ever coming back to life! You must protect me from her vicious attack!
Okay, I will help you!
I cannot accept!

Why can't you do me this little favor? I am so disappointed!!! Okay~ Okay~ Leave me here in this poor, forgotten state!
Who on earth are you? Are you the Valiant who has come to save me?

Basic Conversation with Zidon, the Egyptian Priest Offpspring in Death Valley
Following all of this chaos, the Tomb of King Nam has grown strange once again!  Our descendants are sure to spread the legends of the valiants.
The root of all this hassle is everyone's greed for the treasure in the Tomb of King Nam. Of course, I am not blaming you. It is only natural that you were fooled by Lebalo's smooth talking! As the offspring of an Egyptian Priest, I hope something like this will never happen again! Now only the power of the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Wand of King Nam</FONT> can put everything back to order. I hope you can retrieve the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Wand of King Nam</FONT>!
I'll take responsibility.
I am not capable of such.
Now all of the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Holy Fathers Wands</FONT> are being guarded by the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Guard of the Gold Tower</FONT> in <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Mystique Pyramid Basement</FONT>. You must find and <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>get the wands</FONT>! Bring an end to the chaos!
You can do it, as this is my final request. I hope you can help me! All Egyptian offspring will be grateful for your endeavour!
Though the evil power now lies dormant, I worry that it will once again emerge. I'm afraid <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Alibella</FONT> will stir up a riot because her lover Lebalo has been sealed away again. I hope you can collect the tool needed to seal the soul of Alibella, the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Sealed Stone</FONT>.
Okay~ I'll give it a try!
I think I'll rest again.
<font COLOR=#00ff00>The Sealed Stone</FONT> is now guarded by the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Evil Killer Guard</FONT> in <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Mystique Pyramid Basement</FONT>. I need for you to collect <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>20 Sealed Stones</FONT> for my magic! I'm depending on you now!
The last fight was truly exhausting! Never mind~ I will let you rest up before I ask you for help again!
I have already injected the 20 bottles of warrior spirits that you collected into your body. You ought to be feeling the effects now! I hope that you can manage to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>eliminate the Scorpion Emperor</FONT>, and then report back to me.
I will strive for victory!
I don't feel too confident...
<font COLOR=#00ff00>Scorpion Emperor</FONT> is in <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>the north of Sandfall Maze</FONT>. That place may be full of danger. Be extra careful! I wish you success!
Silly child! Don't underestimate your own power!  Just like when you thought that you were not qualified to be the Valiant bearing the Demon Stiletto!
I am very glad to hear that you successfully eliminated <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Lebalo</FONT>, but another evil known as the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Ghost Party</FONT> is thriving from afar, which means that the revival of the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Scorpion Emperor</FONT> can't be far off. But given your current physical condition you may find it exhausting to fight with the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Scorpion Emperor</FONT>. So I hope you can go <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>to collect 20 bottles of warrior spirits of buried soldiers</FONT>, so that I can enhance your power to eliminate <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Scorpion Emperor</FONT>.
I will go find it immediately
I am really tired!
Don't forget to go to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Mystique Pyramid Basement, and collect 20 bottles of warrior spirits of buried soldiers</FONT>, so that I can enhance your power to eliminate Scorpion Emperor!
No problem, take a rest! But make it quick, because the power of Scorpion Emperor thrives very fast.
Lebalo discovered that you have found out the truth, and therefore hid himself in the locked room!?  That's where he hides since his revival. The place may be disadvantageous to you, but with courage I am sure you can overcome everything!
Now you must bring <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Demon Stiletto</FONT> to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Mirage Oasis</FONT> again to find <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Lebalo</FONT>, and expose the sooth talking of <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Lebalo</FONT>. I think he will have a fight with you! I hope with <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Demon Stiletto</FONT> you will fearlessly defeat the evil!
I believe that I can!
I am frightened!
Great! I hope with courage and weapon you can make it. I look forward to seeing you return with victory.
Why are you frightened???  You are the chosen valiant for <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Demon Stiletto</FONT>. You are the one it believes in!
Now only <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Demon Stiletto</FONT> can eliminate <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Lebalo</FONT>, I hope you can go to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Death Valley</FONT>, and find the legendary <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Demon Stietto</FONT>, which only a valiant can pick up. If you make it, come back to me right away. I will tell you what to do!
What is Demon Stiletto?
Let me start from the beginning... <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Demon Stiletto</FONT> is a legendary stiletto. Allergedly in Ancient Egypt centuries ago, there was a demon called <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Scorpion Emperor</FONT> who invaded the Egyptian empire, causing many casualties and damages! Then there came a valiant who used this stiletto to stab straight into <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Scorpion Emperor</FONT>, and bang!!! <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Scorpion Emperor</FONT> fell down, and was sealed by the Egyptian Priest!  Then the valiant inserted the stiletto in the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Death Valley</FONT> and left without saying a word. Since then no one is able to pick up the standing stiletto, therefore it is rumoured that the stiletto is waiting for its real master!
Okay~ Let me try!
I don't think I am the one!
I hope you are the master that this <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Demon Stiletto</FONT> has been looking for, but we don't have enough time now!  So after you successfully pick up the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Demon Stiletto</FONT> get back to me right away! Remember!!!
Don't underestimate yourself! How do you know if you are not the one if you don't give a try? Think twice before you come back to me again!
Look! This pyramid is the ultimate expression of Egyptian culture!  The great Egyptian culture ~ is the most important heritage of the Egyptian offspring~

Hohoho~ we met again brave hunter. Everyone is helping search for the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Lost Presents</FONT> but there are still many that are not found. Can you help us?
Security 1st squad leader Arthon conversation
I am really thankful for your help. I have already reported that you've passed the security trial mission. Please wait a little longer.
This trial is something that the chief assigned. But first I must warn you that it is a very dangerous mission. Do you still want to go?
Let me do it!
Life is precious....
On the northern side of Holy Plain is <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Saint Field</FONT>, where a ferocious Little Mr. Breeze appeared. They attack travelers. 8 Warriors that went to defeat them have been killed already. Go! For the sake of our brave warriors, I want you to kill at least <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>8 Little Mr. Breeze</FONT>!!
I believe you are brave, deep down inside! If you change your mind, come back.
I appreciate your help!<PF>When I handed the list of people that passed the exam to the chief, he said your rank was not suited to be in the security squad. It's pretty strange, why would he make me look for you in the first place?
Thank you for getting rid of the Forest Sickle Weasels who were destroying our Marmasuisuis the other day. Thanks to you, our Marmasuisui harvest has increased so much!<PF>Man, I didn't expect you to take down those strange Forest Sickle Weasels so easily. You're so agile and graceful! Maybe you can take the final level of the test now?
Anytime!
No more!
Your goal is to eliminate <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>7 Demonic Edges</FONT>. They have been destroying <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Food Marmamimies.</FONT> They look a lot like the Cursed Sword from <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Holy Plain</FONT>, but they are significantly  more powerful, so don't underestimate them!
I can't say that giving up when you're halfway in is a very good mindset. If you change your mind, please come back.
Thank you for getting rid of the Razors Winds who were destroying our Marmahatapatas. Thanks to you, we are producing standard amounts of Marmahatapatas again.<PF>You are amazing, to pick off the violent Sickle Weasels with such ease. This means that you're ready for a more difficult next test, right?
I'll do anything!
I don't want to!
That's the spirit!<PF>Again, our point of interest is <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Holy Plain</FONT>, where they produce plenty of food. Your targets are <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>5 Forest Sickle Weasels</FONT>, who have been destroying Marmasuisuis. Please be as fast as you can. I will wait for you here!
I can't say that giving up when you're halfway in is a very good mindset. If you change your mind, please come back.
Thank you for defeating the Red Demon who were threatening the growth of our Marmakwons the other day. I suppose for you, the Red Demons were nothing!<PF>However, entry into the Security Force isn't that easy. That was but the first step of the test. Are you ready for the next test?
Leave it to me!
Not my job ...
If you say so, let's crank up the difficulty a bit!<PF>Again, our point of interest is <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Holy Plain</FONT>, where they produce plenty of foods. Your target is <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>5 Sickle Weasels</FONT>, who have been destroying Marmahatapatas. They are very dangerous, but I have faith that you will successfully carry out this mission. Good luck!
I can't say that giving up when you're halfway in is a very good mindset. If you change your mind, please come back.
Hello, how can I help you?
I have a report!
Traveling!
Oh, so you wanted to enter the Meteor Pit Security Force! (Hahaha, we found more free labor!) <PF>Well then, we will test your abilities, to see if you are capable of joining us. So, would you like to take the test?
Yes, let me do it!
Test? No way!
The villagers have always relied on Holy Plain from the Southeast to collect food. However, while Holy Plain is a very plentiful land, there are also many hungry Umbra there too.<PF>Naturally, destroying those Umbra who fight with humans for that food is a key job for our security force.<PF>Well then, let's have you start with an easy job. First, I'd like you to go to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Holy Plain</FONT>, and defeat <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Four Red Demons</FONT> who are threatening the growth of the food Marmakwons!
Oh really? I guess it was a lie that you wanted to enter our forces. After all, it makes no sense for you to say you want to join but not take the test. (Darnit, don't get my hopes up for nothing!)
Oh really? You'd like to go to Spiritual Land to the South? The mysterious comet in the basement of Meteor Pit's Spiritual Church is worth a look!
I think you should practice how to absorb Spiritual Energy near Spiritual Land. You know, improve your skills first.
Thunder Hill Night Star Roza
Thunder Hill Night Star Roza conversation
By mixing an opposing monster's dark energy into your spiritual energy, you can more easily destroy the monster and return them to Spiritual Energy. This is called Spiritual Destruction!<PF>Mages each have a different specialized dark energy type, so the Umbra they are good against also vary, but they must learn the skills, spells, rituals, and other techniques through battle experience.
When using Spiritual Energy, the negative power in your body collects to create an even more destructive power! This is the most simple Spirit Controlling Attack.<PF>Have you ever felt your internal energy harmonize with the Spiritual Energy of Umbra?<PF>Absorbing an Umbra' Spiritual Energy can fuel your internal negative energy. By mixing that negative energy into your attack, your Spiritual Energy attains immensely destructive power. If you use this Spiritual Energy to attack a monster, you will probably have over double your normal effect.<PF>Would you like to learn more about the mysteries of the stars?
More please!
I need to rest...
Basic spiritual energy control is general knowledge that everybody knows. However, the secrets of Star Gathering are only taught to newly awoken Mages.<PF>We want more people to understand Mage Spiritual, but at the same time, we can only pass down our legacy to the chosen ones.<PF>The reason Umbra remain Umbra is that their spiritual energy is mixed with dark energy that cannot be converted.<PF>Go to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Holy Plain</FONT> and defeat 5 of each of the following Umbra that look just alike in this order: <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Wiled Water Imp</FONT>, <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Blue Lantern</FONT>, and <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Evanescent Black</FONT>. With your skill, I believe you will be able to tell the difference between each one's dark energy. After defeating them, absorb their spiritual energy.
Yes, taking a break is essential to travel far. Once you're ready, please come back.
By controlling your spiritual energy and mixing in your body's dark energy, you can increase your powers even more. This is the easiest Spirit Controlling Attack, and is the Mage's most simple secret move.
By nurturing your internal dark energy with a proper amount of spiritual energy every day, its strength will grow even more. This is one of the easiest methods of training.<PF>Have you ever felt your own energy harmonize with an Earth Golem's spiritual energy? Absorbing the Earth Golem's spiritual energy will allow you to store and calm the dark energy in your body. Does the concept of carrying dark energy in your body concern you?<PF>No no, there is no need to rush your answer. Just keep that in mind when you come to me again next time. So are you ready to learn the art of Star Gathering?
I'm ready!
Maybe later?
I believe this is, without a doubt, the proper path for you to take.<PF>Go to the Oceanside Island at the Large Middle River of <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Holy Plain</FONT> and find <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>5 Ghosts</FONT>. <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Defeat them</FONT>, and absorb their Spiritual Energy. The bottom half of the Umbra' bodies are translucent, so they should be easy to find.
Yes, taking a break is essential to travel far. Once you're ready, please come back.
If you observe the Umbra well and strike their image into your memory as you defeat them and absorb their spiritual energy, there will be a transfer of energy. This is the easiest way to perform a ritual. Do you ever feel your internal energy harmonize with the spiritual energy of Umbra?<PF>When absorbing their spiritual energy, can't you feel the negative energy riling up within yourself? Hehe, you don't have to answer right away - keep going with your current goals.<PF>Now, are you ready to seriously understand the mystery of the stars?
Please go on.
Wait a second.
I can teach you the paths your predecessors have taken, but the path that you yourself will take, you must decide on your own.<PF>Go to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Holy Plain</FONT> and find <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>5</FONT> green <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Demon Spiders</FONT>. Defeat them and absorb their spiritual energy. These green eyed, 8 legged giant spiders often appear in the southern roads of the plain, so it shouldn't be too hard to find them.
Yes, taking a break is essential to travel far. Once you're ready, please come back.
Hi, can I help you?
Hello
Traveling!
The ever-burning sun does not know the waning of the moon. Where you learned this phrase doesn't matter, the important thing is that you have come to me. This must be fate. Mm... Very well. You unenlightened citizen, you have come to me to learn the art of Star Gathering, yes?
Yes, teach me!
Not interested
I cannot teach it to you directly, but I can tell you where to go. I wish you luck in your learning. Remember! This cannot be rushed! Take it one step at a time!<PF>First go to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Holy Plain</FONT> where your trial awaits you. Find 5 <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Little Ms. Hanako</FONT>, <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>defeat them</FONT>, and absorb their spiritual energy. These monsters always wear sandals, so you should be able to recognize them easily. Now go!
Oh, is that so? I don't know much besides Astronomy. Perhaps the stars are not aligned.
Really? So you want to go to the Spiritual Lands up north? The center of Thunder Hill is a nice place. You should take a look.
Whatever you think, I say you should first go to Spiritual Lands north of Thunder Hill to gain a good understanding and practice with absorbing spiritual force.

Your laughter.... you really enjoy playing with the little kids.
You found that kid? Did you come to tell me that? Thank heavens! It looks like I was right to have trusted you. You really are a good person!
Can I have a second?<PF>Recently the number of Umbra in Saint Field has increased suddenly... The roads that used to be so quiet are no longer safe from monster attacks.<PF>I don't know any details why, but doesn't this story interest you?
Tell me more
Not interested
Actually, we sent in a person to investigate Saint Field. The one who was chosen was our spineless son!<PF>And I'm so worried about him. It's his first time ever traveling so far all alone, and as pathetic as he may be, he's my precious only son.<PF>Unfortunately I'm too old to travel so far now, so I have no choice but to ask you, adventurer. I just felt like you would listen to the plea of this old lady...
Leave it to me
I'm pretty busy
Thank you so much! It hasn't been too long since <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>that boy</FONT>'s left, but from my guess, he would at best have <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>just arrived a Saint Field</FONT>.<PF>That kid is a Shaman, so I really don't know how he's suited for this public safety mission. But now that you're going, I guess I have nothing to worry about. Thanks so much!
Really? (seems disappointed)  Well, its alright. Come back to me when you have time.
Really? (seems disappointed)  Well, its alright. Come back to me when you have time.
It really depends on the situation. I can't be bothersome to people all the time.

Thank you for taking target from Water Drinker. I was able to do the investigation. I didn't find out everything but made a lot of progress. I think I want to return to give a report. Thank you!
Thank you for defeating the Little Mr. Spell Book. Now I know what was causing all the problems.<PF>Water Drinkers appeared in the depths of the forest and took over the other monster's area. But strangely, Saint Field did not have any Water Drinkers before..... And they're suppose to be able to move around freely.<PF>I'm assuming that something went wrong and the Water Drinkers had to come. That's why I want to investigate!<PF>Water Drinker is very cautious  and usually barely moves so it's difficult to enter. That's why I want you to attack the Umbra,  while they're busy, I'll enter. Good luck.
Got it
I'm sorry
Alright good luck! (Defeat 10 Water Drinker and report to Cham) .
Then we have to do this. Go with the original plan.<PF>(Cham takes out some bones used to make soup.) Morph! Morph! Morph! (The bone grows large and covers up Cham.) <PF>This will act as an sacrifice to fool the Water Drinkers.
Thank you for defeating the Green Bats. I was able to run the investigation smoothly.<PF>Originally thought that Umbra were moving with some kind of plan but it wasn't true! Looking at the situation and movement of green bat, seems like where they were originally living became dangerous. Looking at their wounds, seems like they fought but lost and ran.<PF>Not only the green bat but Little Mr. Spell Book ran as well. Just what is going on?<PF>I need more time! So please, help me again.<PF>Until I find out why they're running,  I want you to defeat whatever comes to attack us. Please!
Leave it to me!
I'm sorry
(Defeat 10 Little Mr. Spell Book and report to Cham)
After all that, this is it? Maybe I should test out my thoughts.<PF>(Cham takes out a book and says something. The book becomes large enough so people can fit inside. Cham enters the book and speaks.) <PF>Now I look like Little Mr. Spell Book right?
Thank you for taking care of the Umbra that attacked people on the streets. Thanks to you, we've been able to put in some research.<PF>We believe the reason the Snow Flower Pinkies suddenly appeared in great numbers and attacked people was because their natural habitat was in danger, and they had no other option. We believe this because Green Bats have taken over their old habitat, forcing the Pinkies out to the streets.<PF>There is probably another monster behind all of this, or all these Umbra wouldn't have suddenly moved around in such masses!<PF>We need some more time! So please!<PF>While we investigate the reason for this monster migration, I want you to get rid of the Green Bats that are getting in the way of our progress. Please!
No problem!
I'm sorry
(Defeat 10 Green Bats and report to Cham)
After all that, this is it? Maybe I should test out my thoughts.<PF>(Cham takes out an amulet and places it on his head.) <PF>Now I look like a green bat right?
(So mom does know everything. She knows who is suited to help me. Since there is a string of destiny, what do I need to worry about? Just go without thinking!) <PF>Dandelions bloom all over the place with the aid of the wind. Would you help me with the mission that elder gave me?
I'll follow you
I don't want to
Plant the seed of hope in your heart and pray to grow.<PF>The road of saint field has many ferocious Umbra, causing trouble for travelers. As far as I know, this is insane! Even though they're Umbra, they don't appear on roads for no reason.<PF>The reason why elder gave me this task is without finding out what is the cause, there is no way to solve the problem. I think finding out the cause is the task. But that requires time! For now we need to solve the problem with the road to do investigation.<PF>I cannot do the investigation while dealing with the Umbra, that's why I need your help. While I'm doing the investigation, I want you to defeat the Umbra on the road, I want you to keep the road clean. Thanks!
Follow the wish and the seed of hope walks through land and sky, and swims freely.
(Just because you thought about it, mom doesn't have to come here! It will place mom in danger and make it hard for me to work! Oh? No wait, there's still light in the eyes, am I wrong? Don't worry about that, work!) <PF>Dandelions bloom all over the place with the aid of the wind. Would you help me with the mission that elder gave me?

You don't seem to be a traveling dealer or anything, how did you get here? These days Saint Field main street gets attacked by Umbra and is very dangerous, If you were lost, go home immediately. If you want to train yourself, Holy Plain is much more safe.
San Joel Blacksmith Researcher Akbakov
Basic Conversation with Blacksmith Researcher Akbakov
Oh, it's you! You really helped me a lot. Thank you!
It's you! Thanks very much for your help last time! I used to do only housekeeping work; but  with the Mysterious Spiritual Power Stones you brought to us, I finally started my research. You are my star!   Oh, right. Though I used to be only cleaning around, I still spent time on reading books about Spiritual Power Stones. Have you heard about <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Gigantic Spiritual Power Stones</FONT>, and the long-time <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>rumour</FONT> ? I think that <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>may be true</FONT>!  Among the archive in the Weapon Shop, there is a book recording world-class discoveries, <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Stunning World Records</FONT>. Once in a <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>science expo</FONT>, a <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>gold maker called Hart</FONT> <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>displayed a fist-sized, miraculously glowing diamond-shaped crystal</FONT>. According to the image in the book, the diamond-shaped crystal looks very much like the Spiritual Power Stone! I think <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>it may be the rumoured</FONT> <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Gigantic Spiritual Power Stone</FONT> that can supply a massive amount of energy!  Interested? It's a legendary treasure. If you can find it, you will make a fortune!
Sorry not interested
Making money is my hobby!
Oh, really? That's a shame. Whenever you are interested, please come back to me.
Even so, it's after all just a rumoured treasure, where can we find it? The book was written ages ago, and it is just a narrative. Perhaps it's not true.  Oh, you can <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>ask Sophina</FONT>, perhaps gold makers know something. But don't  expect too much. This kind of treasure will only come by accident!
Oh, it's you! Thanks your for your help last time! With the Large Spiritual Power Stones, any high quality orders will not cause any trouble to Master. Oh, let me tell you a <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>secret about the monsters in Amethyst Cave</FONT> as your reward!  Do you know what the monsters eat? Have a guess? Right! They eat the transparent crystals formed by the  spiritual power crystal groups! Of course it is not groundless! Look at this <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>transparent crystal</FONT>! These white, transparent hexagonal columns <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>are left behind by the monsters</FONT>. As Sophina guesses, these monsters have been having these crystals for a long time, the undigested crystals in their bodies transform into these special crystal forms. I don't know why the monsters eat something undigestable, but I know <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>the function of crystals</FONT>! Yes, <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Sophina once refined it into a kind of Mysterious Spiritual Power Stone</FONT>!   Right, up to this point, you should get what I mean, right? That's right. I want to ask you  <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>to bring me Mysterious Spiritual Power Stones</FONT>. What do you think? Are you interested?
Okay, let me do it!
I am busy!
Hehehe, actually I do not know what I can do with the subtly glowing Mysterious Spiritual Power Stones. But as a researcher, I should spend some time to do an experiment report, right?  I know the transparent crystals are collected from the ghosts in Amethyst Cave, so <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>please beat more ghosts</FONT>. Remember to take the collected transparent crystals to Sophina, she will refine them into Mysterious Spiritual Power Stones. As I heard from Sophina, the probability of refining Mysterious Spiritual Power Stones is lower than that for general Spiritual Power Stones. That's alright, just prepare more transparent crystals. Listen to me. <font COLOR=#00ff00>Mysterious Spiritual Power Stones are not fuels for the blacksmith, so Sophina will  charge you for refining</FONT>. But if you <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>give me five Mysterious Spiritual Power Stones</FONT>, I will give you an appropriate subsidy and reward. I'm sorry having to trouble you, let me say <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>thank you in advance! Thank you!</FONT>
Oh, really? That's a shame. Whenever you are interested, please come back to me.
Oh, it's you! Thanks your for your help last time! With the Spiritual Power Stones, we don't have to worry about the sufficiency of energy now. By the way, have you ever been to Amethyst Cave South? It is too dangerous, therefore the crystal groups there are rarely collected. But they not only can refine into transparent crystallines 1, but also transparent crystallines 2. And transparent crystallines 2 can refine into <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Large Spiritual Power Stones</FONT>,  an excellent material to remove impurities in metal.  Master said quite a few times before he finished: If we can find more Large Spiritual Power Stones, the finished products will be perfect. Right, up to this point, you should get what I mean, right? That's right. I want to ask you   <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>to bring me Large Spiritual Power Stones</FONT>. What do you think? Are you interested?
Okay, let me do it!
Sorry, I'm busy.
Then, spare enough space in your bag. After that, please <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>bring the crystal group sample</FONT>, and go deeper into <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Amethyst Cave South</FONT>, and find</FONT> the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Very High Quality Spirit Crystal Group</FONT>, and <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>collect</FONT> the Large Spiritual Power Stone material <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>transparent crsytals</FONT>. Don't forget to search for several spiritual power crystal groups, because not every very high quality spiritual power crystal group has Transparent Crystallines. So do try your best. When you have collected the Transparent Crystallines, pass them <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>to Gold Maker Sophina to refine</FONT> into energy. Of course not every Transparent Crystalline can refine into energy, so take as many as you can.  Finally, please bring <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>5</FONT> <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Large Spiritual Power Stones</FONT> refined by Sophia, <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>to</FONT> the fuel preparer <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Blacksmith student Adrokov</FONT>! Getting these rare Large Spiritual Power Stones, I am sure he will be very generous to you.

There is no space in your bag. Please tidy it up, or I cannot give you any crystal group samples to collect the materials.
Oh, really? That's a shame. Whenever you are interested, please come back to me.
Oh, it's you! Thanks your for your help last time! The timely Small Spiritual Power Stones solved our energy crisis. Thank you! By the way, have you ever been to the deeper part of Amethyst Cave North?  Do you know? The crystal groups near the entrance are very accessible, and can always refine into  Transparent Crystallines for Small Spiritual Power Stones. They are always picked away before they become crystallines. So <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>if you can collect these Transparent Crystallines for refining Spiritual Power Stones, you have to go deeper into the Amethyst Cave.</FONT>  Compared with Small Spiritual Power Stone, Spiritual Power Stones can provide more and steadier energy, which is the main fuel. But the order is too sudden, we'd better look for more accessible Small Spiritual Power Stones. Do you agree?  Right, up to this point, you should get what I mean, right? That's right. I want to ask you  <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>to bring me Spiritual Power Stones</FONT>. What do you think? Are you interested?

Finally, please bring <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>5</FONT> <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>refined energy</FONT> from Sophia, <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>to</FONT> the fuel preparer <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Blacksmith student Adrokov</FONT>! With these additional Spiritual Power Stones as their reserve, the happy guy will certainly not be mean to you..
There is no space in your bag. Please tidy it up, or I cannot give you any crystal group samples to collect the materials.
Oh, really? That's a shame. Whenever you are interested, please come back to me.
Kind man~ Do you have time to do me a favor?
Tell me what that is.
Sorry I am busy.
Here is the story. Recently, San Joel has a huge demand for weaponry. To blacksmiths like us,  profit increase is certainly good news; but the increased demand for materials is a problem. To create a weapon, we not only need materials; we also need a special energy for the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>fuel</FONT>. Allegedly, the energy <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>origin</FONT> is <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Amethyst Cave North</FONT>. Hard to collect, and the production volume is fluctuating. Fortunately Master has found a reliable provider - - Gold Maker Sophina. But for the sudden increase in the demand for energy, Sophina said she is in short of labor so in a short perod of time. She cannot provide sufficient energy, unless someone can help collect the energy materials and help to refine the energy voluntarily. But this urge quest has to be done as soon as possible, but we have lots of work to do here, we don't have time for that. Therefore, brave adventurer, are you willing to help us, <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>collect the materials from the Amethyst Cave in the Southwest of Snowzone</FONT> ?
Okay, let me do it!
Sorry, I'm busy.
Then, spare enough space in your bag. After that, please <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>bring the crystal group sample</FONT>, and go to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Amethyst Cave in the Southwest of Snowzone</FONT>, and <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>find</FONT> the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>mineral source - Spirit Crystal Group</FONT>, so that you can <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>collect</FONT> the power material <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>transparent crsytals</FONT>. Please try to collect more, because not every spirit crystal group has Transparent Crystallines.  When you have collected the Transparent Crystallines, pass them <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>to Gold Maker Sophina to refine</FONT> into energy. Of course not every Transparent Crystalline can refine into energy, so take as many as you can.  Finally, please bring <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>5</FONT> <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>refined energy</FONT> from Sophia, <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>to</FONT> the fuel preparer <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Blacksmith student Adrokov</FONT>! He is very anxious about the fuel! I am sure the reward will be very satisfactory.
Then, spare enough space in your bag. After that, please <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>bring the crystal group sample</FONT>, and go deeper into <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Amethyst Cave North</FONT>, and find</FONT> the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>High Quality Spirit Crystal Group</FONT>, and <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>collect</FONT> the power material <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>transparent crsytals</FONT>. Don't forget to search for several spiritual power crystal groups, because not every high quality spiritual power crystal group has Transparent Crystallines.  When you have collected the Transparent Crystallines, pass them <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>to Gold Maker Sophina to refine</FONT> into energy. Of course not every Transparent Crystalline can refine into energy, so take as many as you can.  Finally, please bring <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>5</FONT> <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>refined energy</FONT> from Sophia, <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>to</FONT> the fuel preparer <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Blacksmith student Adrokov</FONT>! With these additional Spiritual Power Stones as their reserve, the happy guy will certainly not be mean to you..
There is no space in your bag. Please tidy it up, or I cannot give you any crystal group samples to collect the materials.

You! Good luck, there are still many things ahead of you. Never forget to continue training yourself.
Oh no! What can I do?!<PF>Ooh, it's you. Is heaven's will cleansing or destruction?<PF>What did you bring here?! Hurry and have Leonor make it.
Oh no! What can I do?!<PF>Ooh, it's you. Give my regards to the Allen brothers.<PF>Hmph, that cursed Black Wind Grandma!
Oh no! What can I do?!<PF>Ooh, it's you. She was taken over by the Vampire King!<PF>Go to Plague Dungeon and meet with the Allen brothers. Thank you, and good luck!
Oh no! What can I do?!<PF>Ooh, it's you. Have you found Leonor?<PF>So that's what happened. In order to defeat the Vampire King completely, you'll need to remove its fang. Good job!
*sigh* How could this happen. It's an embarrassment to our Warrior Society!<PF>I'd like to shun her for her lack of training and getting dragged down by the Umbra, but I must do my best to save her life.<PF>However, even if we manage to bring her back, there's no guarantee we'll be able to rid the monster's influence.
What are you worried about?
You sure talk a lot!
Oh! Young one, what good timing you have. Warrior Society is in a state of emergency right now.<PF>We need to approach this incident carefully lest Warrior Society's strength fall apart, and get taken over by the other societies.<PF>This case is absolutely top secret, so we must be sure to not leak it to the outside world. So, I'd like you to solve a very difficult problem for us!
Difficult problem?
I'm going to make dinner...
In short, we Warriors have the responsibility to protect the safety of the people in order to uphold the honor of Warrior Society.<PF>No matter where we are, our job as Warriors is to uphold the will of Warrior Society.<PF>However, among us there are some who don't share this strong will... I'm sorry, I can't say who though.
Okay...
She was taken over by Umbra, and has betrayed us.<PF>She showed false love and stole our top secret documents, handing them over to an evil devil. I don't know whether to forgive her...<PF>I'm sorry, I am no longer capable of giving judgment on this case, and must rely on you to learn heaven's will.
What should I do?
I can't hurt my brethren
We already captured the traitor, but we must rid her of the Umbra' influence as soon as possible.<PF>We already have an expert tracker chasing down the whereabouts of that devil, and according to his reports, that devil is hiding in Corpse Church in Saint Field.<PF>Take this proof that you have permission from me to him, and he will tell you what you need to do.
*sigh* I don't want to either.<PF>However, if we don't stop her, our Warrior Society will crumble.<PF>This is for the greater good. This hurts me too! I actually want to...<PF>No, nothing. Just forget about all this!
Really! Well then, once you're done eating dinner, come back to me. Don't you dare forget! The fate of Warrior Society lies in your hands.
Oh really? I guess so! I feel older with ever passing day.
Young one, what is it?<PF>You look like a beginner Warrior, so if you want to survive in this dangerous world, you're going to need to train yourself more. Come back when you're stronger!<PF>...Maybe I'll ask you to take on that case.
Ever since I was little, I believed solely in justice, and wanted to become a Warrior who defended mankind.<PF> Unfortunately, I have my limits. All I can really do is work hard to find and teach talented young ones, and help the The Order of Masamune grow.<PF>You! Don't you want to change Warrior Society? If you have that will, it is never too late to start.

What is it? Are you here to defeat Umbra again?
Watch out for the Black Wind Grandma's magic! She's a tough opponent!
What is it? Have you forgiven Allen's moodiness?
Youth is such a beautiful thing. I mean, you got healthy so quickly! Alright! Well, lets not put your good health to waste and get you straight to work!<PF>That Black Wind Grandma is a really dangerous monster, using young girl's bodies and spirits as her own limbs and putting them to evil deeds.
Bad deeds?
That is... It's not for kids to know! That's not the point!<PF>The important thing is that the monster isn't in Corpse Church, but rather in Plague Dungeon.<PF>I already have Allen watching the entrance to the cave, so I want you to head there right away.<PF>Ask him how to remove the Black Wind Grandma's heart.<PF>Oh, and I'll warn you beforehand, but he's a really impatient guy, so you'll have to deal with that. Alright, good luck!
Do you remember what I said?<PF>Yes, in order to remove the spell cast on Marianne, you need to defeat the Vampire King and remove his fang.<PF>This devil that took over Marianne is hiding here in Corpse Church, and he's called a woman killer.<PF>This is as much as I've managed to investigate, but I'm not particularly good at battle, as Arthur knows, so I guess that's why he sent you...<PF>I suppose your mission is to defeat the Vampire King?
In his place I will not fail!
How could this happen to her...
Why me...
You'll do it in that weakling's place? Hahaha, you sure talk a lot!<PF>However, isn't it a bit dangerous, going in all alone? The enemy is rather powerful.<PF>Well, fine. Once you're ready, I'll tell you how to get to the hidden room.<PF>Of course, if you insist on going alone, I won't stop you, but please do be careful. The transfer point to the hidden room is in Corpse Church B1, in the main hall.<PF>Once you're ready, off you go! Don't forget to bring back the Vampire Fang.
Torture him? Well then, you have to remove his fang! <PF>However, isn't it a bit dangerous, going in all alone? The enemy is rather powerful.<PF>Well, fine. Once you're ready, I'll tell you how to get to the hidden room.<PF>Of course, if you insist on going alone, I won't stop you, but please do be careful.<BR>.The transfer point to the hidden room is in Corpse Church B1, in the main hall.<PF>Once you're ready, off you go! Don't forget to bring back the Vampire Fang.
Are you so emotionless as to not mind watching an innocent girl fall to the hands of the Vampire King?
Shh! I'm currently on a top secret mission. YOU SAW NOTHING!!!
This is a very dangerous place! As your senior, I'm warning you to leave now if you aren't fully confident in your strength.
What did you come here for? Leave!<PF>I don't want any more of my Warrior Society brethren to die. Leave now, this isn't a place for people like you.

Allen Basic Conversation
We meet again! You must be really bored! By the way, you think you're strong, don't you? In my eyes, you've still got a long way to go.
When Arthur asked you to take this mission, he probably mentioned something about heaven's will, right? When he mentions this, there's always something more than just solving the problem.<PF>What do you think that is?<PF>It's to examine how you approach this problem, and to determine your qualities. Then he knows whether you are suited to be a Knight or an Demon Slayer.
Knight's qualities?
Demon Slayer's qualities?
Easy.<PF>Knights of Warrior Society value glory, and are glorious in all of their actions, never giving up against Umbra. They receive the blessing of the Warrior Society, training their White Magic!<PF>The job of a Knight is to always be willing to risk their lives for Warrior Society's glory, exterminating all Umbra in their way.
And Demon Slayers?
Listen up, Demon Slayers of Warrior Society don't worry about little details. They don't mind resorting to Black Magic in order to defeat Umbra.<PF>They are willing to use any means available to become more powerful. They are far more difficult to control than Knights, lone wolves who sometimes can't even be moved by the teachings of Warrior Society.
Become a Knight
Become an Demon Slayer

Easy, Demon Slayers of Warrior Society don't worry about little details. They don't mind resorting to Black Magic in order to defeat Umbra.<PF>They are willing to use any means possible to become more powerful. They are far more difficult to control than Knights, lone wolves who sometimes can't even be moved by the teachings of Warrior Society.
And Knights?
Listen up, Knights of Warrior Society value glory, and are glorious in all of their actions, never giving in to the Umbra. They receive the blessings of Warrior Society, training their White Magic!<PF>The job of a Knight is to always be willing to risk their lives for Warrior Society's glory, exterminating all Umbra that stand in their way.

If you still need time to decide, forget about the class changing mission and come back to me again.
Do you still remember what I said regarding that hag monster?<PF>Oh well, I'll tell you again.<PF>This <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Black Wind Grandma</FONT> monster is good at magic, has a smelly aura, can hardly be scratched by a regular sword, and if you aren't careful, you'll get poisoned.<PF>I'd recommend going with friends, but if you insist on going alone, you'd better be careful!<PF>Alright, that's all I have to say so...<PF>You know what to do, right?
Yep, ready!

Young one, I'm glad you're here! I'm so happy to see you grown up so quickly. I'm actually in a bit of a dilemma right now, so can you be of help to this old man?
Anything you say
You're creepy...
Haha, you truly are the good student I thought you were. Listen carefully.<PF>We at Machinist Society have pursued happiness for mankind through the years. We pray that our scientific inventions will make life convenient and earn us the respect of the people. We don't plan on profiting from this respect. Glory means nothing more than the clouds to me.<PF>Do you think this empty word is that important?
You're right!
I think it's very important
I truly appreciate those words...<PF>I'm glad that a young one like yourself already has developed proper morals. I just wish all members of Machinist Society were like us.<PF>*sigh*, Unfortunately, some young ones are blinded by greed, leaving themselves open to be taken over by Umbra. I can't stand seeing this!
Who?
I'm sorry, but I can't say.<PF>I don't want you to judge or punish them. I just want you to collect some peculiar materials.<PF>Perhaps... If I made them a magical toy, I could bring them back to sanity.
What can I do?
What if I can't...
I've already sent those who lost their sanity to a playground with the Child Pacifier Machine. Before the effects of the machine wear off, I need to hurry and make the toy.<PF>I'm sorry, but first, could you go to Corpse Church at Saint Field and find a cute girl? She should be willing to help us out.<PF>If you find her, she should have some useful information. But... She loves to play hide and seek, so it may be a pain trying to find her.
Hey! Have faith in yourself! Because I have faith in you.<PF>Believe me, you can do it! The path ahead of you is wide - you can't let a little roadblock stop you!
There's no need to hurry. When you hurry too much, you miss out on wonderful things!
Yes yes, you are an honest kid. At least you can speak your mind. You're still young. Some day you will learn the importance of this thing called life.
Hmm, youth is such a wonderful thing. At that age, you're still full of naive and simple ideals and passion.<PF>How wonderful it would be if people could stay like that forever.<PF>I want you to retain those ideals forever. And you need to train yourself more. Also, could you visit me some time?<PF>I have something I need to ask of you.
I hate those gross Little Sweetheart beans. However, even though it's also from Little Sweetheart, I love fresh milk. Do you want a glass? It'll make you stronger.

Aha! Are you here today to play with me?
Watch out for the Black Wind Grandma's magic! It's really hard to dodge!
Dalasnikov wasn't affected by the Thousand Year Tree Spirit, was he?<PF>Hehehe, I told you he'd be fine.
Oh... I haven't hidden yet.... Oh well, it doesn't really look like you want to play anyway.<PF>Well then, let's go on with your mission.<PF>That old tree spirit is called the Black Wind Grandma, and her whole body is covered with snake-like things. She's good at controlling people's hearts, disguising herself as a beautiful girl and attracting males.<PF>Hahaha, if you encounter her in the cave, you'd better be careful!
Careful of what?
Hahaha, don't make me laugh! Pretending to be all innocent. Anyway, if she appears, you'll know.<PF>Those Grandmas are hiding all over Plague Dungeon. Dalasnikov went ahead to investigate, so try asking him how to remove their hearts.<PF>What is it? Is Dalasnikov okay? Don't worry, he's completely immune to beautiful women.
Hide and seek is my favorite game! That's why our principal told me to play here!<PF>That devil is apparently an incredibly handsome man, but too bad! I hate guys who are born so beautiful! And what does he want with our Instructor? The concept of profit has blinded him, and all he thinks about is glory and gain.<PF>That monster's fang can apparently counter dark magic, so go grab it! So yeah, could you defeat <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Vampire King in Corpse Church</FONT>?
I'm the most lovely of all!
I was born to kill Umbra.
No way!
If you do defeat him, you would be the greatest hero on earth! But you'd better not forget to bring back the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Vampire Fangs</FONT>.
Well, thanks a lot! Hehe, you defeat Umbra, I hide. Oh, but you'd better not forget to bring back the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Vampire Fangs</FONT>.
Attractive? Give me a break! The Vampire King may be handsome, but he's a terrible monster, playing with people's hearts!
Shh, be quiet. The devil will notice you.<PF>What are you doing? Hurry up and go find Principal Bacherikov! He probably wants to see you too!
Hey! You're such a cutie. But this isn't a place for people like you!<PF>The Umbra inside are incredibly vicious, so just head home. Otherwise, I would feel terrible if you were injured or something worse.

During bad times, you never know what'll happen! Isn't that right?
Ever year, it stays by one star, just like Saturn, which looks unimpressive, yet affects everything!
Be honest and calm, like Mercury. When the star appears to the north, all will be revealed.
Mars has many forms, with no true shape. Its actions are limitless and have many consequences on the world.
From sunrise to sundown, the bright Venus will shine, leading you to success.
How pure you are, with such a bright shine in your eyes! You must be the reborn hermit, a true blessing. Finally, the one we have been waiting for has arrived.<PF>This must be fate.<PF>No matter how high the risk, I must tell your fortune!<PF>Woah, what is this! Such powerful thoughts from you!  Well well, I suppose I have no other options!
What are you talking about?
I'm so confused!
Yesterday, I had a dream. After wandering everywhere, I had dangerous but interesting experience. For some reason, I began to sing. It was because of the purple aura that came from the east  that predicted many foreigners to come here.<PF>And now look, you appeared up today! You showed up, abiding to heaven's fate! Now the Mage's Soul Power will be saved!
What do you mean?
As you know, most Umbra are formed from spiritual energy. Their usage of spiritual energy and soul power is innate. They can basically use it on a whim.<PF>Now, analyzing the Umbra' spiritual energy manipulation and stealing their skills is something we all do. However, therein lies a problem!<PF>Some people began to absorb the Umbra' evil spiritual energy in order to attain the power to control spiritual energy! These fools who seek nothing but power were absorbed by the Umbra and became half human, half Umbra....
That's new!
Evil! We must destroy it!
New doesn't always mean better. Have you forgotten that the difference between humans and Umbra is our will?<PF>We Mages can control, use, and convert spiritual energy into attacks. What is needed is will. The stronger the will, the stronger the ability to control spiritual energy. Therefore it is essential that we train our hearts.<PF>I'm sure they thought they used external energies in a smart way, but such amateur moves will only result in destruction of themselves!<PF>In order to absorb such external energies, it is essential that we train incredibly hard first. Even I am probably not yet ready to do such a thing...<PF>You probably understand the gist of the situation now. Well now, I suppose you're wondering where you fit in...
Where do I come in?
Are you talking to yourself?
Absorbing monster powers into your body will allow you to vastly increase your spiritual energy absorption and destructive powers very quickly.<PF>However, you will lose your conscience, lose control of the powers, and fall into a state of confusion. These side effects are too great for some humans, and that's how they get corrupted.<PF>Well, now it's too late. We must find a way to solve this problem. I used a barrier and spell circle to hold them in, but it's only a temporary solution. Beyond that, I must rely on you.<PF>Of course, in order to rid the monsters' effects, we must first find out what monster took over them.<PF>I already sent people in to investigate, but Kansinro asked for reinforcements at Plague Dungeon B3. Apparently there is a fairly large roadblock.<PF>Then, as I was reading fortunes, it said that a savior would come. And now here you are today, our savior! If you go help Kansinro, I have no doubt that this operation will succeed!
I shall go!
I really don't think so...
Everybody has different fates when they are born, and you, with such fortunate stars, will undoubtedly be the best fit for this operation. I know it's a lot to ask, but please go to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Plague Dungeon B3</FONT> and find <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Kansinro</FONT>. He should tell you what you need to do.

Oh, was I dreaming? Which means that you must just be a figment of my imagination. That really sucks! Now, I need to wake up.
Hmph, what is righteousness? What is evil? As far as I know, they're basically the same thing.<PF>Have you forgotten that the difference between humans and Umbra is our will?<PF>We Mage Spirituals can control, use, and convert spiritual energy into attacks.

Watch out for the Vampire King's close range attacks! They really hurt!
So you finally found Tououro? We've played hide and seek since we were kids, and she was always the last one to be found. Pretty cool, huh?
The <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Vampire Fang</FONT> can't be found in any ordinary vampire's mouth. Not even a Drapper. It has to be from a PenUmbra known as the Vampire King who's lived at least 1000 years.<PF>The prophets are having <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Tououro</FONT> investigate Corpse Church, where they say there is a thousand year old Vampire King. However, we haven't received noticed ever since...<PF>Could you go find <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Tououro by the entrance to Corpse Church in Saint Field</FONT> and ask what's going on?
Leave it to me!
Another Errand? Maybe later.
I am really grateful. Good luck!
The more talented is, the more he must work. You don't have much time to rest.
Did you come here after hearing from the prophets? I'll explain the investigation results to you then.<PF>Through long investigation, I found that the spiritual energy they absorbed was actually a mixed spiritual energy!<PF>Intense! I was so surprised!<PF>First timers have hard enough of a time dealing with one type of dark spiritual energy, let alone two!<PF>But finding out that it's a mixed energy isn't enough. In order to remove the monsters' effects from the people, we'll need a special material that mixes the two spiritual energies. So the reason we're here is to collect this material - <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Tree Spirits of Blackish Green Tree</FONT>. The Tree Spirits of Blackish Green Trees are only found on Black Wind Grandmas who have trained for a thousand years.<PF>I'm sure you know, but these monsters are hardly ever seen, since they only live in this cave. With effort, I managed to get into the cave and find the hidden room. However, I'm not very good at combat, so...<PF>I'm sure you know what I'm going to ask of you now, right?
Leave her to me!
I'll go back and report now
Thank you so much. Tell me when you're ready, and I'll tell you how to get to the hidden room.
Um, aren't you the savior who was going to rescue us? Or are you just a messenger?
What are you doing here? Profit? Hey, don't you need to change classes? Hurry up and go the Mage's Cave in Thunder Hill and talk to the Golden Prophet.

You bored? Did you just wander here?
So you understand why you must collect the Tree Spirit of Blackish Green Tree and Vampire Fang, right?<PF>Yes, it's so we can remove the mixed spiritual energy from these people with a special magic tool. Removing the demon is a slightly forceful skill. We can control the dark energy, but it will leave scars on the body. And it could also prevent the growth of the person later on. Actually, the reason the Prophets sent you here was because you are the savior!<PF>You cannot turn away from your calling. You must choose one of these paths now! What happens now is up to you! These materials can create two completely different tools, so it's all up to you now!
Bloody Crimson Drum
Green Light Religious Amulet
This is an item that will primarily use the Vampire Fang and use the Tree Spirit as support... The Bloody Crimson Drum.<PF>It uses the property of light and dark to absorb each other, pulling out the dark energy from the body by using light energy.<PF>In this method, the dark energy is disposed out of the body, so the body could become slightly charred, and there is a side effect of slow healing in the future. This is the style of the Taoist... To control evil.<PF>Strong willed and violent, Taoists keep destroying Umbra as their top priority, without regard to the pains of the victims. All you think about is chasing out evil, so you end up causing your victims to suffer.
Green Light Religious Ammulet
This uses the Tree Spirit of Blackish Green Tree as the main, and uses the fang as support. The Green Light Religious Ammulet. Relying on the heavenly paths, you create a hole of spiritual energy in the target, pulling dark energy out of there.<PF>However, this method pulls the spiritual energy out of the head, so the victim will temporarily have white hair. Also, they will lose all of their spiritual energy, every last drop.<PF>This is characteristic of the Exorcist, not worrying about little details, working earnestly to rid the body of evil.<PF>Honest to yourself, and never wondering about good and evil, the victim will not suffer during the surgery, but afterward, he will be completely devoid of spiritual energy.<PF>Alright, that's it. Which path are you going to choose? A Taoist with the Bloody Crimson Drum? Or the Green Light Religious Ammulet wielding Exorcist?

The savior I waited for so long has finally arrived!<PF>This is the situation, so do you think you could take down the Vampire King in my place?
Of course!
Let me think about it
Thank you so much. But I feel bad sending you alone - the enemy is so powerful... Well, if you're ready, I will tell you how to get to the hidden room.<PF>If you want to be a lone Warrior, I will not stop you. I did warn you though. All that matters is that you retrieve the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Vampire Fang</FONT>! That's all I ask!
You are the savior! The divine being who descended from the heavens! The one that the prophets promised me!

You need me? Hmph, I don't care! Bye bye!
You should hurry up and go to Wizard's Cave in Thunder Hill and talk to the Golden Prophet about a class change.

Basically, they need to use their own will and spiritual energy to regain control!<PF>However, is the only thing we outsiders can do is pray?<PF>No!<PF>We can't strengthen their will and spiritual power from the outside, but by using the power of heaven and earth with a holy relic, we can help them regain conscience!<PF>So here's the main point. In order to produce the relic, we need two types of materials that are rather difficult to collect, one of which is the Tree Spirit of Blackish Green Tree.<PF>The Tree Spirit of Blackish Green Tree is only found from thousand year old Black Wind Grandmas, a monster that is fairly difficult to find.<PF>They hid in Black Wind Vase and hardly ever show themselves. However, we managed to find Black Wind Grandma's hidden room. I'm sure you know what I'm going to ask of you now.<PF>As our helper, could you go defeat <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Black Wind Grandmas</FONT> in <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Plague Dungeon</FONT> and grab the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Tree Spirit of Blackish Green Tree</FONT>?
That's what helpers do!
Too much responsibility!
Thanks. Once you're ready, let me know, and I'll tell you where to find the Black Wind Grandma.
I guess nobody's perfect.
Hurry and go to the girl.
Bravery is a universal truth, but going without preparing like you are isn't bravery, it's basically just suicide!
My friend, when approaching the unknown, caution is your strongest weapon.

Those who doubt faith with reason are rejecting faith with their heart without realizing it. They probably think they can understand their heart with reason. It's a thought as foolish as trying to breathe through ears.
Do you understand the reason we're collecting materials?<PF>Yes, it is to create a relic to heal the people who were consumed by the call of the wild. These materials can actually make two entirely different relics though. In the end, you will have to choose just one of these two relics. I'll explain them to you, and you can decide which to make on your own.

You've already changed classes, haven't you? Why don't you forfeit the current mission and take on a new one?
Our savior, you've finally come.<PF>You may already know, but we finally found the legendary Vampire King. We searched all over Corpse Church in order to take the Vampire Fang, but we couldn't find the monster for the life of us.<PF>However, while leaving, we found a device that revealed the hidden room. There, I found the Vampire King in the middle of a meal, and thought it was the perfect opportunity to strike, but he had already noticed me, and I was heavily wounded, barely escaping.<PF>I sent a message asking for help, and the reply simply said that our savior will arrive soon, so just wait a little.<PF>I guess the savior Kansinro mentioned finally arrived! So do you think you could defeat the Vampire King for me?
Leave it to me!
Okay
Once you're ready, let me know. I'll tell you how to get to the Vampire King's room.
Every day, we must learn from our mistakes from yesterday, no matter what pain and suffering it takes. I want to remove all of the evils from my heart, and help defend the world as a pure being.
First, look for Nature inside Plague Dungeon. So don't bother our investigation for the hidden room right now1
Are you lost? The Black Wind Grandma is in Plague Dungeon. This is Corpse Church!
Young one, work hard! You are talented and brave enough, yet you waste time here. Hurry and go to Thunder Hill and discuss your class change.
It isn't a bad idea to try take back your family's honor in respect for you ancestors. However... simple arrogance is just foolish.
My friend, having allies with whom you can share both the ups and downs of life is an irreplaceable asset. I pray you find help in your paths.

Huh, I wasn't joking!
Uhmm... Nope!
Yes, yes! By the way, do you know the first step to becoming a great savior?
No I don't
I don't want to know
Young one, our bodies still retain the mysterious power that the princess of the heavens left us. However, we must unlock it in order to use it and defeat the Umbra. Find somebody who will unlock if for you. That's the first step to becoming a savior of Luciena!
Not interested!
What do I do?
You're giving up? You wimp...
There is a strange child, an odd boy, in this world. You should probably take his training. If you met him already, good job! If not, go and talk to him!
I'm ready to do that!
I'm not ready for that
Before becoming a savior, the most important thing is empathy. Caring about other people is a prerequisite to obtaining that power. Got it?
Where do I start?
Okay
First, you need to learn some important skills about classes... Ely, standing next to us lost her son. You need to find and talk to him.
Okay okay! I'm so glad you'll help. First, you need to learn some important skills about classes... Ely standing next to us lost her son. You need to find and talk to him.
If you don't want to, that's fine! You'll just regret your foolishness later. I hope you won't lose your life because of this...

Eric went out to try saving the world. However, you seem more powerful than him. Do you want to give yourself for the crusade for humanity? In the plain by the exit of the village, there is a girl named Silispear, so you should try talking to her.
Whenever you're free, do you mind listening to Eric?
Can you listen to my plea again?
Okay, got it!
Sorry, I'm busy
I'm worried about his health. I want to make him lunch, but I don't have ingredients. Could you collect them for me?
I hate collecting ingredients!
What do you need?
You aren't very useful.
Thank you so much! I want <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>3 Half Eaten Puddings, 2 Pumpkin Vines, and 1 Straw</FONT>. You can find these from Slime Puddings, Unified Pumpkins, and Straw Bats in Trial Cave. Good luck!
Just when I thought Eric finally made a good friend. I guess not. If you're free though, please do talk to him.
I wonder what Eric is so worried about? *sigh*... If only he'd talk to me about it......... Could you talk to him for me?
I don't think I can help
Okay, I'll try

Okay, got it!
No! If I see my mom's face, I might lose my resolve... I really don't want to leave my old mother behind, but... *sob*...
Can you hand this letter to my mom? Tell her that I'll be back in two years, and to wait for me. Thanks! I need to go now... Or I might start to lose my resolve.
Hehe, recently I've been able to beat Gobs in wrestling! Wahaha! I think I'm getting stronger.
Thanks for proving it to me! Umbra really aren't that scary! I just had no confidence, so I didn't have the courage to stand up to them. But now I have passion and courage. If I try hard enough, maybe I can become like you some day. I'm going to train here a little longer. But I really don't want to worry my mom too much, so can you go tell her I'm doing fine?
Um... Okay
Um... Are you sure?
Thanks!
Okay, I'll tell her you'll think of other things too.
Heh... You're pretty good! You did fine against the Bats! Why don't you try beating Bakkos now?
No problem!
I'm too busy for this...
If you bring me 5 White Furballs from Bakkos, I'll believe you!
What a liar!
What can I do? What on earth can I do?
Have confidence!
Congrats!
Umbra are scary~ I get tired from fighting just one Slime Jelly. And other Umbra are even scarier! Oh no... How can I go back? I'm so stupid!
I can't take them either
They're not that strong
I thought you were a good person...
Weak?! Even Slimes are scary! How could I ever fight other Umbra.<PF>I don't even know if I can make it to Trial Cave... Fine, if you say they're so weak, can you beat those Bats on the shore?
OK, no problem!
My stomach hurts
Hmm, let's say you defeat 7 Bats!
What a liar!
Hmm, thanks! You too.
What can I do? What on earth can I do?
What happened?
You coward!
Shut up! Who are you? Leave me alone!
What! I'm... I'm no coward, I'm just... just thinking about my future here.<PF>Stop making false accusations! I... I've already decided to leave here and go to the mainland and defeat Umbra with allies. But... I'm just wondering what to do right now.
It's true!
Tell me about it
Shut up! Who are you? Don't tell me mom told you something weird! Tell her to just leave me alone!
Okay... sure!<PF>In order to fight Umbra, you need to train and attain various skills. Warriors who specialize in physical combat, Mages who defeat enemies with spells, Shamans who save people with the power of nature, Machinists who love science and engineer things. I'm still not sure what I'm meant to be though.
How are you saving the world?
What is your interest?
Of course by defeating all Umbra and not letting them ever come back! Ugh... My dad was killed by them! I can never forget this anger.<PF>But my body is weak, unable to wield a sword, don't particularly have an affinity to nature, don't even like reading notes... The only thing I have is my strong will to defeat Umbra!<PF>Don't tell my mom. I'm sick of being lectured.
MmHmmm... I read and like studying spells and... even read incantations. Is there anything that I can do?

Okay!
I'm so tired...
What's with that face! Don't you want to get out of Beginner's Village? If you do, go defeat the Magical Book and save Blijan!

No need!
Okay!
So you don't believe me... Long ago, the Four Holy Warriors that sealed the Umbra were just like you. However, now that you're here, you can't turn back...

"Alright, let me explain.  Long before we humans existed, there was a Heavenly Princess and the King of Earth.  In the beginning, they lived peaceful lives...<PF>However, the king became envious of the princess. He tried to destroy the earth and its people, whom the princess loved dearly. He created volcanoes, deserts, and glaciers. In his fury, he also created creatures known as the Umbra, and the more powerful PenUmbra, to massacre the humans. <PF>The motive of the Umbra is to gain knowledge of Soul Power, harnessing its strength.  However, due to the king's corruption when creating them, they can only seek this power through  the suffering of others. <PF>The Heavenly Princess spent all of her energy to save us. Regardless of her efforts though, we were not out of danger. In order to defend ourselves, we studied the usage of spiritual energy. It was then, through the efforts of the legendary Four Holy Warriors that we discovered how to unlock our spiritual  energy.<PF>Unlocking is a means of allowing the Heavenly Princess' power to flow through you and control spiritual energy.  If you can control this method of energy, you will be able to see the unbelievable, and learn  wonderous things.<PF>I charge you with the protection of mankind, to defeat the monsters, and bring peace once again to Luciena.

Alright! You were chosen by me, so have confidence! I can see a lot inside you! Now close your eyes, and imagine the princess of the heavens. Now, summon the Umbra Guide inside your body, and go out into the world! So long, I pray that all goes well! When peace comes to earth, I hope you will be able to complete your Umbra Guide.
Hey! Sorry, I forgot! Do you know about the Umbra Guide?
What is it?
It's pretty cool!
The Umbra Guide is the last relic that the princess of the heavens left us on earth, a book with the power to absorb the spiritual energy and body of Umbra. Long ago, the Four Holy Warriors also used this book to seal millions of Umbra and  their leader, the OtroSoul, bringing peace to earth and the realm of Luciena.<PF>However... years have passed, and now the petty bickering caused the seals to weaken. This caused the Umbra Guide and Hisii Chambers that sealed the Umbra to be destroyed, releasing the OtroSoul, who then released all of the Umbra. And now, the millions of Umbra are once again ready to destroy the realm...
What should I do now?
What can I do?
It's okay. Don't worry. Before leaving this world, our mother, the princess of the heavens left us one tear. That tear, along with spiritual energy, is melted into our bodies. If you have the will to save the world, that tear in your body will be summoned, producing an individual Umbra Guide.<PF>The stronger the courage and will, the stronger the Umbra Guide that is produced. Do you want to unleash your own Umbra Guide?
Yes, of course
Can the likes of me do it?
Alright! I like people with confidence! I really think you're something special! Relax and let your spirit focus! Once you're ready, let me know.

If you have the will to save the world, that tear in your body will be summoned, producing an individual Umbra Guide.<PF>The strong the courage and will, the stronger the Umbra Guide that is produced. Do you want to unleash your own Umbra Guide?
Yes, of course
Can the likes of me do it?
Alright! I like people with confidence! I really think you're something special! Relax and let your spirit focus! Once you're ready, let me know.

Hey! Sorry, I forgot! Do you know about the Umbra Guide?
What is it?
It's pretty cool!
The Umbra Guide is the last relic that the princess of the heavens left us on earth, a book with the power to absorb the spiritual energy and body of Umbra. Long ago, the Four Holy Warriors also used this book to seal millions of Umbra and the king of Umbra, bringing peace to earth.<PF>However... years have passed, and now humans began fighting amongst themselves. This caused the Umbra Guide that sealed the Umbra to be destroyed, releasing the monster king. And now, the millions of Umbra are once again ready to destroy the earth...
What should I do now?
What can I do?
It's okay. Don't worry. Before leaving this world, our mother, the princess of the heavens left us one tear. That tear, along with spiritual energy, is melted into our bodies. If you have the will to save the world, that tear in your body will be summoned, producing an individual Umbra Guide.<PF>The strong the courage and will, the stronger the Umbra Guide that is produced.

Main Quest -- Spiritual Land -- Martak Basic Conversation
Sorry, I'm feeling really bad. Let me rest for a bit....
Did you go to Thunder Hill and investigate Elle's background? She seems suspicious...
I'm so sorry, she says she wants to be friends with me, but I'm suspicious of her!<PF>She is in a different tribe from us, and thinks differently fro us. I feel there is a need to investigate her some more.<PF>Could you investigate for me?<PF>There's a guy called <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Badaty</FONT> who knows about a lot of things, so you might find something if you ask him. He's a crazy alcoholic, so he's probably in the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Tavern</FONT> right now!
I'm busy!
So much work...
Well then, I'll wait until you're free.
Don't say that! We're best friends, aren't we?! So yeah, I'm leaving it to you.
Get out of here, I don't even want to see you!
I see, so her name is Elle - what a beautiful name...<PF>Woah! What is it, all of a sudden? But perfect, I was just going to go find you.<PF>Um... Haha! I was wondering if you could deliver something else.
I refuse!
Boy am I unlucky!
Why! I thought we were like brothers, sharing both our ups and downs.<PF>What a fool I was. To be rejected by you like this, I'm truly sad...
Oh... Really? But I'm sorry, I must have you do this regardless. For my future, and for the lineage of the Martak family...<PF>So, will you help me out?
Okay
Tell me what to do
In Meteor Pit, there is a retired but very talented craftsman. Accoding to legend, the paper cranes he makes are able to fly--even over Sacred Hilltop. And I hear he can make sturdy desks from wood filings.<PF>Now that I received a present from Elle, I want to send her a little gift too. So, I want you to take this Blood Ruby and have him make a bracelet.<PF>The craftsman is in his Work Shop to the south west.
And once this is done?
What an annoying old geezer!
Don't say that - we're buddies, right? So thanks a lot! I hear that craftsman is a bit moody, so if you go late or something...<PF>Since he's so old and senile, he won't take you seriously.
Please, clean out your bag. The bracelet material won't fit if it's this full.
Hahaha, I actually don't like him either. But his skill is undisputable. Well, good luck!

Um... So... The pretty girl that picked up the badge, that Elle girl? Um... I wanted to say thanks so... I have a little present for her, so could you... um.. You know? Help me out, please!
So you like her
I'm tired
What?! Fine. Just go back, and don't come back to me!
Wait... wh.. What's with that attitude! I need to train new Warriors, so I have to stay here.<PF>Hey! You got a reward from me, so just help me out again! Didn't you like that reward? If you deliver this present, I'm sure you'll get something nice!
Alright, fine...
I'm too tired
Hahaha, thanks a lot! Tell her Thank you for picking up the badge, I will never forget this deed. This is just a little token of my appreciation.<PF>Alright, I'm sorry for making you do this when you're tired, but good luck! Oh yeah, if she asks you anything about me, answer properly! Thank you!
Please clean out your bag. If it's this full, Elle's present won't fit.
Tsk, so useless even though you're young. I can tell apart good Warriors in a glance. The Warrior army doesn't need wimps like you!
Hmm, where'd it go? I had it when I ate breakfast at the McMeal Restaurant! Why is it gone?<PF>Did I drop it when I rushed to the bathroom at noon?<PF>What should I do! If I lost that, my life is over.
Haha, what a fool
What are you looking for?
How dare you laugh at somebody's misfortune! Don't tell me you think you're a member of the Warrior Society like that! You're just a wolf wearing sheepskin!
What a kind person. However, this is too important a deal, so I can't let the information leak...
I won't tell
Never mind
Hahaha, what a funny guy... Argh, it's not time to be celebrating! I'm in a panic after having lost my <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Warrior Badge</FONT> that proves I'm a Warrior Trainer, and I listen to your silly jokes...<PF>Oh no! I let it slip...
I didn't hear anything
It's okay, I get it
You didn't hear anything? Really? No lie? Really, nothing, right?<PF>Alright, you can go now! No need to silence you anymore too. Now go play! Bye ~
You get it? Get what? How would you understand my struggles as a Instructor.<PF>Teaching kids these days is tough. I cant give physical punishment, and I'm not even allowed to yell at failures like you.<PF>Eventually Instructors are going to lose all their power. Ahh.....
I'm going to tell everybody
I'm going now
Wait! I have nothing more to say, but it's exactly as you heard. I was careless and lost my important Warrior Badge. That was my proof as a Warrior... I'm over now.<PF>I never lost my badge before, but why... Oh! I remember!<PF>Today, when I went to Thunder Hill, I asked for directions from a pretty girl by the statue of the bird, maybe I dropped it then...<PF>I'm busy though, and can't go on my own. Could you go ask her for me?
Got it!
Sorry
Okay, thank you!
*Sigh*, okay... You'd better not tell anybody.
Go away, I don't want to see you face. Thanks to you I have a headache, and I even got sand in my eyes. It's sand! I'm not crying! Don't say anything weird to people.
I'm... sorry. I wasted your good intent, it's my fault
Welcome to the land of glory, I am the Lieutenant of the Warrior Army, Martak. Pleased to meet you.<PF>Hmm... The new Warriors haven't reported yet? Are they lost?

Tsk tsk tsk, it looks like we'll have to research hwo to defeat the monster's spiritual energy and make them stop their madness!
Did you go to Thunder Hill and investigate Elle's background? She seems suspicious...
This girl is strange. We got into a fight because she said such weird things, and now she wants to be friends. I don't have time for this girl, I need to research the climate change.<PF>But she really is weird, let's ask <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Badaty</FONT> at the Tavern and investigate her history.
I'm busy!
So much work...
Well then, I'll wait until you're free.
Don't say that! We're best friends, aren't we?! So yeah, I'm leaving it to you.
Get out of here, I don't even want to see you!
*sigh*, I admit it. I'm bad at controlling little climate changes.<PF>Oh yeah, the tea that girl brewed me the other day was really good. It looks like she's a specialist in this field, but can you ask her the secret?<PF>Oh yeah, I should probably give her a present too. I'd like you to help out...
I refuse!
Boy am I unlucky!
I haven't even told you about it, and you already refuse. Fine! I won't make you then.
Don't say that! I've spent my life analyzing vapor pressure. If this succeeds, I can make many people happy!<PF>What have you done for mankind?
Okay
What's your real point?
There's a talented craftsman in an Work Shop to the southwest. He's arrogant, but apparently the paper cranes he folds can fly over Sacred Hilltop.<PF>And he can even make a sturdy desk out of wood filings. I want to have him make a bracelet out of this Cat's Eye and give it to that E... E... Elle girl.
And once this is done?
What an annoying old geezer!
Come on, don't be like that. Just think that you're helping mankind right now, and you should be okay.<PF>You want people to be happy, so you should be fine. Oh yeah, that craftsman is moody, so watch out.
Please, clean out your bag. The bracelet material won't fit if it's this full.
He's a weird one, but his skills are undoubtable! I have nobody else to turn to, please!

The birth of steam is... is it from fire of water...?<PF>Ahhh... It's all thanks to that girl that my precious badge came back to me. I should show her my appreciation, right? If so, can you go in my place?
So you like her
I'm tired
Wh... what... You... you like her too? Hahaha, just kidding, nothing!
Really? Ah... I troubled you before, so I shouldn't ask too much from you...<PF>Hey... There's a kiss mark on my badge, which has been bothering me. What should I do!<PF>Can you help me? The present's already ready.
Alright, fine...
I'm too tired
Ooh, I'm so happy! You're such a good person. Well then, thanks a lot, when you're back, I'll share my experiment with you.<PF>Now, let's go to the happy world of vapor together...
Please clean out your bag. If it's this full, Elle's present won't fit.
...This is bad. We're about the same age, but you have way too little experience Lakena!<PF>When we're stuck on a topic in work, we would work three days straight without sleeping. You, this is no good.
Huh? That's weird... I had it when I was eating breakfast at the McMeal restaurant! Why is it gone?<PF>Ahh! I already lost it nine times, so I can't ask for a replacement anymore!
Haha, what a fool
What are you looking for?
That's right, I'm really a fool!  Even now, I can't solve the problem of saturate vapor pressure and vapor pressure. Can a fool like me really make an impressive invention?
Ahh, thank you for your worry, but this is something I need to solve on my own. I don't want people to find out what a fool I am. Well, I guess everybody already knows I'm stupid!
I won't tell
Never mind
Hahah! Thank you. But I'm sorry, I really don't think it would be a good idea for me to tell you that I lost my Testament of Coach... Ahhh! I finally said it....
I didn't hear anything
It's okay, I get it
You didn't hear anything? Really? No lie? Really, nothing, right?<PF>Alright, you can go now! No need to silence you anymore too. Now go play! Bye ~
Ahh, I'm so sorry. I'll let you know that I am usually very careful about everything. However, sometimes people make mistakes.<PF>Well, it's like they say, even trees fall off monkeys.<PF>I mean!<PF>Even Taoisteys faEven monkeys fall off trees.
I'm going to tell everybody
I'm going now
Ooh, wait a second, it's actually as you just heard. I was careless and lose the testament of coach that I just got resupplied. This is already my tenth one!<PF>This is really bad, I know I can't get any more replacements...<PF>Oh, I just thought of something! Today I went to Thunder Hill, and asked directions from a girl by the bird statue... Maybe I dropped it then...<PF>So that's what happened, but I'm busy and can't go there myself. Can you go ask her for me?
Got it!
Sorry
Okay, thank you!
*Sigh*, okay... You'd better not tell anybody.
Hey hey hey! Are you really that emotionless? Didn't you come to help me?
I'm so sorry, but my honor is on the line. So please help me out!
So! Do you want to discuss saturated vapor pressure together? It's too boring waiting for new students all alone!

There are far too many Umbra here. We must think of some way to seal them.
Did you find out about that girl?
...I'm so sorry! I just cracked there. But to make me angry, that girl is pretty impressive. She's very suspicious...<PF>I don't like meddling people, but I have no choice. Can you go find <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Dadaty</FONT> at <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Crystal Altar</FONT>? You're my only hope now, go ask about that girl's background.
I'm busy!
You're such a pain
Well then, I'll wait until you're free.
Don't say that! We're best friends, aren't we?! So yeah, I'm leaving it to you.
You fool! How dare you show yourself in front of me! Go, don't make me hurt you.
To challenge me! I wont lose to a little girl!<PF>Perfect timing, take this Spicy Soup that I made, and have that little girl try it out. I wonder what she'll say!
I refuse!
Boy am I unlucky
You fool! How dare you refuse me. Fine, no matter what happens to you, don't expect me to help you out.
You fool! Why do you say such a thing? The pride of our society is on the line.<PF>How could I, who was once called the Master of Soup lose to this little girl?
Okay okay
Master of soup?
Now that you got it, go to Crystal Altar and find Lydu. She's the most talented one around here, and is the only person to have ever beaten me.<PF>Take this Mountain Soul Herb to her. Then have her use that to make a curry spice.
And once this is done?
Don't want to go
What's with that attitude! Once this case is complete, I'll accept you. If something ever arises, I'll consider helping you.<PF>Now hurry, Lydu loves to sleep.
Please clean out your bag, if it's this full, the Mountain Soul Herb won't fit.
So you won't go? Okay, I got it, then our friendship is over. I guess we weren't that great of friends to begin with.

That little girl, stealing from me! This is a first! Do you still have special feelings for that girl, huh?
So you like her
I'm tired
Haha, a dweeb like you talking about love. Makes me laugh!
You get tired so easily because you don't get enough nutrients... How sad, at that young age. However, I can probably fix that for you.<PF>But first, I want you to carry something to the girl from Meteor Pit.<PF>How's that sound? I'll give her some of my left overs. This will show that I appreciate her honest and modest personality!
Alright, fine...
I'm too tired
Ha! Well good for you! Now go! I promise something good will happen when you come back.
Please clean out your bag first. If it's this full, my gift for that girl won't fit.
I see! That means you're malnourished! We need to deal with this soon, or you'll suffer irreversible consequences!
To think that it's gone.... Why is it gone? I had it when I was praying in the morning at Wizard's Cave. I guess I'll just pretend nothing happened and look for it later.
Haha, what a fool
What are you looking for?
What are you talking about? From your appearance, I can tell that something bad is happening to you. Yet you still insist on laughing at others, huh?
I can't trust thieves. Either way, you and I are strangers, why must I tell you? If this information spreads, I'll be done for.
I won't tell
Never mind
Ha, even if you aren't going to talk, I probably will. If you're that honest, I'll let you in on my secret.<PF>My precious <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Inscription</FONT> is gone, so I need to find it.
I didn't hear anything
It's okay, I get it
Remember! If I find out you spread this story, I'll crush your ears.
Hmm? Do you really understand? I've been testing your intellect, and I don't think you're capable of comprehending me.<PF>However, I am a good enough instructor to teach even the likes of you. How lucky you are!
I'm going to tell everybody
I'm going now
What?<PF>Blackmailing me, what nerve! I like your bravery.<PF>Alright then, I'll tell you. Charace sent me into the evil Meteor Pit. I could never stay in such a terrible place.<PF>After finishing my job, I left as soon as possible. I must have dropped it when I was in such a hurry!<PF>I vaguely remember a girl being near me. In which case, it's possible that she has it...<PF>However, I'm busy and can't leave here. Could you go ask her for me?
Got it!
Sorry
Okay, thank you!
Don't forget!
Ugh! You aren't even phased by irony!
Go! Don't meddle in others' business
...Do you need something? I'm not interested unless you are a new Mage...

There are far too many Umbra here. It looks like I should continue training with the village elders.
Did you find out about that girl?
I'm so sorry! I just cracked earlier. I guess I still need training.<PF>However, I can't forget about that girl! If I can, I'd like to save that girl from evil. So I was wondering if you could go to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Crystal Altar</FONT> and find <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Dadaty</FONT>.<PF>I want you to try investigating that girl's background. If we find her background, maybe we'll find out why she's like that. Then we could save her!
I'm busy!
You're such a pain
Well then, I'll wait until you're free.
Don't say that! We're best friends, aren't we?! So yeah, I'm leaving it to you.
I don't want to talk to you, move aside.
How is that girl from before? Is she still causing mischief? There might be a victim of mischief somewhere...<PF>Oh, perfect timing. I want to send that girl a present, but do you mind helping?
I refuse!
Boy am I unlucky
Okay... Got it! I won't bother you anymore then.
I'm so sorry. I can't leave here, so I truly appreciate your help.<PF>People have started turning evil these days. Umbra have affected them, conRice Lakenating them with greed. I'm afraid of letting you energetic young ones run wild. They will get lost in their power and greed.
Okay okay
What do I do?
I'm glad you understand my troubles... There is a <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Healing Breath Essence</FONT> at my place. Can you take this to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Lydu</FONT> at <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Crystal Altar</FONT>?<PF>Have her make a <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Healing Aroma</FONT>.
And once this is done?
Don't want to go
That's right. Thank you so much. Lydu is very talented, so I trust her herb skills. That's why I want her to make the Healing Aroma. You should hurry though, Lydu likes to sleep a lot.
Clean your bag first, or the Healing Breath Essence won't fit.
I guess I have no choice...

Mm? Why would that girl do such a thing? Can you go tell her not to cause such mischief anymore? Tell her not to do anything she might regret later. Here! Take this to her. Hopefully she'll understand.
So you like her
I'm tired
I don't hate her, but I can't forgive her actions. Be careful not to get influenced by her.
It looks like you're not doing so well. You have to go out and exercise more.<PF>From now on, be sure to go out in nature and inhale nature's fresh air.<PF>Now go! Be sure to listen carefully and do as I said.
Alright, fine...
I'm too tired
Okay okay, if you listen to what I say and give this to her, I'll give you a reward. It's really nice!
please clean out your bag first. If it's this full, my gift for that girl won't fit.
Okay, I won't make you. But just to let you know, unless you train yourself, you won't grow anymore. Be careful about this.
!?<PF>How did I lose such an important thing? I was just cleaning it with Souka juice this morning too! Did I drop it when I was tending to the flying pigs?
Haha, what a fool
What are you looking for?
What in the world are you saying? Everybody can have a dangerous phase. It is these times that people need the most kindness. That way, you won't get hated.
You're so kind. But.. It's such a big problem that if it leaks out, some heartless people would use it for evil. Then the problem would get even worse!
I won't tell
Never mind
Alright, then I'll trust you.<PF>I will stay here to greet the new Shamans. The <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Ring of Wizard</FONT> that I had was proof of being an instructor. I am really worried now that I lost it. I just hope nobody takes it and uses to fool other Shamans.
I didn't hear anything
It's okay, I get it
Lying is terrible! You must tell the truth! The most important thing for us humans is honesty and a big heart. I want you to learn this fact.
I'm so happy that you'll help with my problem! If you act selflessly, your heart will naturally become cleaner, and you will learn things you never knew. And once you learn, you will be able to approach things you never knew. And the thing is...
I'm going to tell everybody
I'm going now
You're so persistent. Alright! Let's return to the main topic.<PF>Now that I think of it, besides helping those pigs, there was nothing out of the ordinary. However, I did go to Meteor Pit earlier... What kind of a way is that to live? There are machines everywhere, the air is dirty, and you can hardly even breathe.<PF>When I passed the Work Shop, a little girl asked me some questions. Maybe I dropped it around there!<PF>Could you go ask her if she's seen my ring? I have things to do, so I can't go myself. Can you go ask for me?
Got it!
Sorry
Okay, thank you!
Okay... Got it.
Come on, don't say that. I'm actually not a very talkative guy.
Now, have fun! Take a good look at the world, you'll probably realize that it is worth your efforts.
Why do humans live in this world? It's in order to learn the greatness of nature, not to destroy it. We mustn't destroy spirits willy nilly, remember that!

Whether you have or not, you should know best. I don't want to talk about this. Just leave!

I'm innocent
I actually stole it
Don't just say that. Go find the truth and prove your innocence.<PF>To be honest, I think Martak is falling prisoner to his love. She must be lying and trying to make you the scapegoat.<PF>I recommend you go talk to her about it!

Whether you have or not, you should know best. I don't want to talk about this. Just leave!

Haha, I actually heard from my sister, but recently the Meteor Pit army has been recruiting.<PF>So, are you interested?

Maybe
I don't think so
Now that Marma's harder to find, the prices of all the foods have gone up.<PF>This is all because of the cursed monsters in Holy Plain. Therefore, the Meteor Pit people decided to run a mission to kick all the monsters out. Do you want to help out too?
No thanks
Sure
Wow, that was a flat out rejection.
Oh, you're such a nice guy. Just letting you know, the monsters in Holy Plain are significantly stronger than the ones in Spiritual Land.<PF>I'm worried.

The Pot must be definitely harmful to us.<PF>Oh yeah, when I woke up, there was a weird bell I never seen before next to me.<PF>So, do you want to take the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Bell</FONT> and go investigate the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Pot</FONT>?
Sounds interesting
Not interested
The Pot might have already made it into Thunder Hill. Try asking around.<PF>Maybe <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Dadaty</FONT> would know something. When <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>investigating</FONT> the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Pot</FONT> though, don't forget to bring this <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Bell</FONT> with you.

Allegedly, before the Sealed Tower in the Sealed Land appeared, it was struck by a meteor that has fallen from the sky. The tower remains intact, but at its north there is a small crater.  The crater is on the only pathway to the Sealed Tower for <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Mission and Science</FONT>. Travellers rest inside the crater; gradually it became a gathering place for <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Warriors and Machinists</FONT>, and is called <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Meteor Pit</FONT>.
I want to take a look
Oh, I see!
I am a Preacher commissioned by the Four Societies, to send people to the entrance of Meteor Pit to the north of the Sealed Land.  Do you want to go? Just give me <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>1 Requiem Stone</FONT> for the magic, and <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>50 gold</FONT> as fare. It takes just a flash. Don't worry, my magic is safe.

There is another dock across the river, and it is exactly the same as the one here. However, the ocean temperature is high here, so it is famous for seashell production. However, the other side has a low ocean temperature, so it is famous for its starfish production.

Expensive?     <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>If you think 1500 gold coins are expensive</FONT>, that just means you're lucky you've never been cheated!
Haha, I will have you know that Yazoo and I are the boatmen of Star Pier and Shell Pier, and we are responsible for ferrying people back and forth.

Specter Station is located underneath the sea. It is a fairly huge scientific project. However, ever  since the invasion of ghosts and monsters, it has become a means of transportation. We can use it to travel to the East and West Exits. <PF>Now, you might ask why people would still bother using this outdated form of transportation. Well, the reason is that they want to find the control room, inside which is housed a super energy stone that powers the whole railway. No one knows if such a thing even exists or not.

May the Snow Monster be with you!
May God Arnoobis be with you!
May the Armored God be with you!
May the Flame Dragon be with you!
You, who have been an Illusionist for ages must have witnessed the mysterious intrepidness of nature? I've heard that a ceremony will soon be held for your changing to Soul Master class. How surprising that you have already reached this level of comprehension and training at such a young age!   I will stop my greeting words here. Now prove to me that you have the power and that you are prepared to participate in the ceremony!  Firstly, I will ask you to pick <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>50 Heaven Flowers</FONT>. This is to see if you have the power to synchronize and borrow forces from nature!   As for the method of picking those flowers? Head to the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Snowzone</FONT> and look for the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Adventure Soul Master Leon</FONT>! She will tell you what to do.
Fine, I'll go!
Shouldn't I pack essentials?
Then I will wait here for your good news.
Your backpack is full! Go <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>make space in your bag first</FONT>, then come to me again! Or else I can't give you the Reduction Spells!
This is the only chance. If you missed it, it'll be gone. Pack your essentials, and do what I tell you to do, or else even as you regret it later, you have no choice but to fail!
May the angels be with you!
Good day. I wish you safety and wellness!

Conversation with Meilin
Congratulations on becoming a Sorcerer!  I hope you will make great contributions to civilization!
May Biyofily be with you!
Okay then, you seem to have a sound base!  I am responsible for testing you in theory and basic technique. Then after that, there is the practical application. Go to the Sorcerer Jassy who is adventuring in the Arctic Tundra. She will tell you what to do next.
I see. Thanks!
Ah?  Haven't you finished the test?
Come on! I believe you can do it! Just go!
Don't take it as such a simple task!  Not everyone is able to be a Sorcerer!
Er, good! You have once again proven to me your abilities!  Now that you have accomplished the task I gave you, it's now my turn to do something for you.... Take your time. the pretest has not been finished, but as a reward, I will tell you something you should know before taking the next step! <PF>Do you still remember what Biyofily the Goddess has done for this world  It is said that the goddess cried when the world was in ruins, and mankind was so harmed. Powered by her tears and the nimbus, she stopped the world from certain destruction in order to protect mankind. When she had finally used up all her power, she turned into a pillar of smoke and disappeared. <PF>Although the goddess has gone, her spirit is always here in our hearts. She even accounts for a part of the nimbus in the nature. We Sorcerers have a greater ability to respond to the pure nimbus, and we possess the special ability to refine energy from it because we are close to the goddess. <PF>Try to get an idea of what you have done a few days ago. As a matter of fact, spirit purifying is a training practice, where killing the Spriggan will obtain you the nimbus. Therefore, what follows next is a test for nimbus refinement.
Please tell me more!
Can I take a rest?
If you want to refine energy, you have to be close to the goddess. If you want to be close to the goddess, you have to understand that the goddess seeks to protect the beauty of nature! Go to Snowzone for 5 Jingyan Sacrificial Altars, which may help you obtain the heart of nature. However, you have to obtain three purposes from the 5 Jingyan Sacrificial Altars, or I cannot allow you to pass!
I will make the effort!
The Jingyan Sacrificial Altar and the Heart of Nature
It is not hard for you to achieve this, but you have to find 5 sacrificial altars somewhere around Snowzone!
Haven't you gotten it yet?  You should calm down and think more carefully. When you finally understand, you can come back to me!
Is that all?  Well! Did you need to go the bathroom or something?  I imagine you'd want to purify your body, right!
Er, good! Your action has successfully strengthened my confidence in you! Let me tell you what to do next... <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Go to Snowzone to find the Freezing Chamber, and kill the Snowy Grandma inside</FONT>!  It is not easy to do, because although the Snowy Grandma is timid, she is most assuredly a force to be dealt with. <PF>She is very dangerous! During their growth, they gradually poison the nature around them, especially in the snowfields! In order to protect our earth, we should make every effort to kill them all especially when they hide in the Cold Room, into which <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>one can only enter using Colored Transport Crystals</FONT>. <PF>What's more, they bear special skills. When they are knocked down, there is always another that emerges in its place. It is truly a huge pain to deal with!  But how about it?  Are you scared yet to find out about the second test?
I'm fearless! Leave it to me!
A little bit.
Er, I'll wait for your good news!
When you understand the agony of nature, you will not be frightened any more!
As a Sorcerer for a long time, you must have experienced the circle of life! I heard that you can hold the Sorcerer transfer. What a wonder! You are so young, and yet you have such potential!<PF>But enough of the polite formalities. Prove to me that you have the ability to hold the Sorcerer transfer!
How should I prove it?
Can it transfer without you?
The first test is to pick <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>50 purified spirits</FONT>. Go to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Tasla Plain</FONT> for <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Guobao</FONT>, <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Tunao</FONT>, <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Duomu Demon</FONT> and <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Huanyan Demon</FONT>. They live off of purified spirits. However, you must remember to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>take</FONT> the spiritual power <FONT COLOR=#00ff00> I give you <</FONT>, or else the monsters will be taking purified spirits without you seeing it! Remember to pick 50 spirits!
How do I collect spirits?
Can I go there later?
Start out early and come back early! I'll wait for your good news here!
You backpack is full! Did you actually want to take the pretest?   Please <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>clear it up</FONT> and then come back to me! Otherwise I cannot give you your tools!
Come back to me when you want to take the pretest!
You take it too much for granted!  Do you think that everyone is able to be a Sorcerer?
Come back to me when you achieve a higher level!
May Biyofily be with you!
Good day. I wish you safety and wellness!

Conversation with Shumei
Congratulations on becoming a Sorcerer!  I hope you will contribute more to the Secret Cult civilization in the future!
Come on, you will find it!
You are great! I didn't think you could finish the exercises so quickly. Next comes the actual combat and the last step is to look for the Myan downstair of the Ice Cave!  However I need to brief you first or else you will be at a loss during actual combat. <PF>Do you know the four relics:  Holy Blade, Heaven Chain, Wand <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>and Legendary Gods Seal</FONT>   It is said that these were the four relics that the Four Heroes used to seal and lock up the devil!  However, with the destruction caused by a human traitor, the place where the four relics were kept was blasted away and the four relics were disrupted. <PF>The devil escaped and led the monsters to do harmful things to the world. In order to kill monsters and seal the devil away, the four relics must be revived. However, they disappeared after the explosion. <PF>As a member of the Tantrism Civilization, I will seek the four relics which belong to the natural civilization, but lately I feel I've been on to something!
Is it good news?
Have you found the seal?
The location of the seal is just the place where you are heading towards: the Ice Cave, which is controlled by monsters. It is incredible! We have actually dispatched a great cavalcade to round up them. We will use our skilled glyphs and conjuring to follow them, and you will be one of those following the monsters.
Look for the seal, right?
Should I transfer first?
Yes, exactly! If you find the seal, it will be a vital contribution. With your personal abilities proven then,, I promise you can be transferred to a Sorcerer! It is definitely a one in a million chance!  If you do not go, you will end up waiting a long time before the next chance comes. This is an important responsibility. Do you wish to take the task?
Ok, I will take the chance!
Let me prepare.
Remember that you are going to look for the Myan located below the Ice Cave. Now go!
Well, adequate preparation is also very important. When you are prepared, you can come back to me and I will explain it to you again.
Transfer first? Do you think that everyone is able to be a Sorcerer as long as he is capable? Of course not! Besides just personal ability, the ability to cooperate with others and evaluate their achievements is also very important! <PF>As such, do you want to take on this important task of supporting the front line and seeking the relics?
Ok, I will take the chance!
Let me prepare.

I have more or less grasped the general information. The location of the seal is just the place where you are headed towards: the Ice Cave, which is controlled by monsters. It is incredible! We have actually dispatched a great cavalcade to round them up. We will use our skilled glyphs and conjuring to follow them, and you will be one of those who pursues the monsters.
Er, I thought you were asking me to look for the seal, right?
Should I transfer first?
Yes, that's right! If you can find the Legendary Gods Seal, it's going to be a great contribution. I believe you are skilled. You will be qualified to be a Sorcerer!  It's a good opportunity to contribute to our civilization! It is hard to say when you can have the same chance next time. Are you willing to take the responsibility and execute right now?
Ok, I will take the chance!
Let me prepare.

You seem to have mastered a bit of skill fighting with a small force. Very good! You are able to handle those griffins by yourself. It means that you have mastered this skill! What follows will be more difficult. Do you have confidence in yourself?   Whatever happens at the very least, I have faith in you!  Trust me. I would not ask you to do things that are beyond your abilities! <PF>I think you should have heard recently about a rare monster called the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>One Eyed Beast.</FONT> They ravage across the Arctic Tundra! Yes, they are your objective! It is not easy for to discover their hideouts. You probably will not be able to fight with them alone! <PF>But don't worry!  It is not required for you to fight alone, so you can bring a friend along. The third step is to cultivate your abilities to cooperate with others, because the enemies are so more powerful than us. <PF>Ah, I nearly forgot to tell you where it is. It is <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>at the side of the road, SouthWest of the Arctic Tundra</FONT>. There are two huge rocks standing here, and there is also a bouquet of <FONT COLOR=#00ff00> Colored Transparent Transfer Crystals</FONT>. As you touch the transparent crystals, you can immediately enter the Cold Room.
Ok, I will go!
I'd like to find a friend first.
Good! You finally have faith in yourself! I will be right here waiting for your good news!
Yes, I believe it is necessary. In that case, I will be right here waiting for you. When you have prepared, you can come back to me and I will explain it for you again.
Ok, You have finished the first step, so now you can move on to the second. Have you heard of a mysterious monster called the Chilly Griffin  It is said that you can achieve a higher grade if you pull out one of his feathers and insert it on yourself! <PF>But let me tell right now that it's all a bunch of nonsense! You are promoted only when <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>your potential has increased.</FONT> It has nothing to do with grabbing a feather from a griffin during combat. However, it is true that the Chilly Griffins are fairly mysterious, because they live hidden in the<FONT COLOR=#00ff00>the Freezing Chamber,</FONT>  which is secret and rather hard to find. <PF>One is able to arrive there by using <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Colored Transparent Transfer Crystals</FONT>. So did you get all that?   Neither you nor I need any griffin feathers, but if you want to be a Sorcerer you have to be skilled enough to take on several griffins at the same time by yourself! <PF>Therefore, the next step is to find <FONT COLOR=#00ff00> Colored Transparent Transfer Crystals</FONT> from <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Snowzone</FONT> in order to go to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>the Cold Room</FONT> and kill <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>all of the Chilly Griffins</FONT>. Then you can come back to me!
Ok, I will go!
Does it really work?
I await your good news!
Yes! Yes! Yes! How many times do I need to say this  Trust me! Trust me! Trust me! Trust me! Trust me!    How strange that a rumor can spread so quickly, while nobody believes it when it's the truth!
Hi buddy, please stay! You look full of energy. Are you at the level of a Neutralize master?   Are you wondering how you can become a Sorcerer?
How do you know?
I want to keep a low profile.
In fact, I am a commissioner dispatched by the prophets to help you. As long as you follow my directions and finish each step, you will definitely be transferred successfully!
Tell me what I should do!
You're a fraud.
It is a bit annoying, but you just have to go through the right channels. First you should learn how to collect the amulet! <PF>I am not lying to you! We of course do not need the amulet to conjure, but we are in fact a branch of the Secret Cult! Although we often have different views, this is one thing we all agree on. We catch the amulet for them and then they extract the energy for us! <PF>Once again, you should trust me!  Absolutely, you should trust me! In fact, you should do whatever I tell you! <PF>This is <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>the incantation, here.</FONT> Take it, and <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>go to </FONT> Saint Bay, where there are many <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>similar monsters</FONT>. Try to beat them!  Remember to spare some room in the bag in order to take back the amulet. You should give me at least <FONT COLOR=#00ff00> 50 amulets</FONT> a time!
Ok, I will go!
I'm leaving town..
I await your good news!
Your backpack is full. <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Please clear it.</FONT> Then, come back to me!  Otherwise I cannot give you the incantation!
This is the only chance you have. Pack quickly and go. Otherwise you will regret it!
Oh please! You didn't hear people squabbling. You didn't hear your family crying! You didn't even hear anything about tax returns or lottery wins. Which swindling group have done none of these things?   See, this is the insignia given to me by the prophets--Sworn Sorcerer. I'm the rumored mysterious civil servant. Can you believe me now?
Low profile? If this is what you want, then there's nothing I could do.
Come again after you have leveled up!
When you are killing defenseless monsters, what are you thinking? What do you feel?
May the god of Zhishi bless you.

Liumeu Basic Conversation
Congratulations on becoming a Magus! I hope you could make more contributions to the High Mage Society in the future!
Remember what I told you: The death of the Instantly-Frozen Lizard Man is related to the location of the God's Seal? Please carefully listen to my explanation!   I think you should still remember what Kousin said: <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Young Asura has a good chance of appearing in the Ice Cave in the Actic Tundra</FONT> ?  Because there is the Devil Ice Mirror in the Ice Cave that concentrates the aura of the world. This is exactly what Asura, who uses his aura to pollute the holy artifacts, needs!   In fact, the Prophets have sent spies over to ascertain the fact. They already have the Teleporation Crystal which can transport a regiment into the Magic Mirror But none of them landed on the spot where Young Asura is located!  To avoid being found, Asura used the Instantly-Frozen Lizard Man as a media to create a seal: <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>People who uses the Teleportation Crystal to reach the Demon Chamber have to have the Instantly-Frozen Lizard Man Aura with them.</font> <PF>That's to say you need the Instantly-Frozen Lizard Man to use the crystal to find him. Asura didn't realize that by killing the Instantly-Frozen Lizard Man, one will have its aura!  Now you know why I asked you to defeat the Instantly-Frozen Lizard Man a while ago?
So that's why!
I'll go to the Ice Cave
So relax. As long as you have the Instantly-Frozen Lizard Man aura with you, you can definitely use the Teleportation Crystal to reach the Demon Chamber where Asura resides!   But remember not to barge in by yourself! Wait for your comrades before you <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>enter the Demon Chamber to defeat Young Asura and retrieve the God's Seal</FONT>! I guarantee that your team, led by you will be transported with you to the Demon Chamber!   We have no time. You have to set off now!
I'll look for comrades now!
I am going now!
Hm, this is indeed necessary. Then after you are prepared, come look for me again. I will explain to you once again.
I'll rely on you then.
Yes, of course you are going! But remember not to barge in by yourself! Wait for your comrades then <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>enter the Demon Chamber to defeat Young Asura and retrieve the god's seal</FONT>! Don't worry, as long as you have the Instantly-Frozen Lizard Man Aura with you, I guarantee that your team, led by you will be transported with you to the Demon Chamber!
I'll look for comrades now!
I am going now!
Hm, this is indeed necessary. Then after you are prepared, come look for me again. I will explain to you once again.
I'll rely on you then.
Work hard, you will find it!
Hm, seems like you can hold your ground! Now are you willing to take an even more difficult challenge?
I don't have a choice do I?
Is this a challenge?
Hm, shall I say you're willing to take challenges or being able to see the situation clearly? Hehe,  work hard! Come come come, let me explain to you first. You know that four holy artifacts: Holy Sword, Heaven's Lock, Spirit Staff and <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>God's Seal</FONT> ? The legendary Four Heroes used these holy artifacts to create a seal to lock up the Wicked King's body! But because of the human traitors, an explosion happened at where the seal is located! The four holy artifacts are damaged. The seal is broken. The Wicked King escaped and lead his minions in endangering the world. To eliminate all demons, and seal the Wicked King's body again, the four holy artifacts have to be found!! But even the damaged artifacts have disappeared when the Wicked King escaped.   As part of the High Mage Society, I keep on searching for one of the four artifacts - the God seal, which belongs to the High Mage Society. Now I finally have some news!
Is it good news?
Found it?
Although we only found traces of the God's Seal in Spectre Station, this could be good news! The prophet already sent Kousin to investigate, but the Specter Station is just too big. We don't have enough people, so Kousin hoped there'd be more people going there to help.  So? This isn't a bad job, right? Retrieving the God's Seal is a huge achievement! If you are willing, <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>go to Specter Station West Side to report to the Adventure Magus Kousin</FONT>. He will tell you what to do next.
Let me do my part!
I don't like running around!
Then off you go! I've heard that Kousin is worried about the five clumsy sisters who were lost after being sent to investigate. Maybe you can help find them.
Rather than study through books, you should accumulate experiences by journeying. With your present limitations and you still want to be a Magus? Dream on!
Not quite, just that colleagues found traces of the God's Seal in Spectre Station. The prophet already sent Kousin to investigate, but the Specter Station is just too big, We don't have enough people, so Kousin hoped there'd be more people going there to help. So?

You are both title defender and challenger! You passed the previous tests to take on more difficult ones at the next steps. Challengers and title defenders are the same thing. If you stay within your limits and never breakthrough them, you will never become a Magus.
Great, you have perfected the first step! Then let me tell you what you have to do next-- <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Go to Snowzone to find the Freezing Chamber, and defeat the Snowy Grandmas that live in it</FONT>!   This is not simple, because the Snowy Grandma is a cowardly and cunning monster and very dangerous! They poison the land, especially snow fields while they grow up!  To protect the land, we strive to eliminate them, but they hide in Freezing Chambers which can only be accessed by the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>teleportation crystal</FONT> and they can duplicate themselves. For each one you defeat, another one appears! Such a huge pain!    So? Now that you've heard of the second test, are you afraid?
Why would I be afraid!
I'll run! I'm good at running!
Let me remind you. In order to avoid alarming the Snowy Grandmas, you have to go to the Freezing Chamber alone. That is, you have to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>defeat all Snowy Grandmas alone</FONT>!   Hehe, you wouldn't have been scared by something like this, right? I'll wait here for your good news!
Hahahaha, it would be correct to say so, but you should be confident in yourself. Otherwise, how could I dare to ask you to take on such a task!
Hi buddy, please stay! You look so full of energy. Have you attained the level of Exorcist Master? Are you wondering how to become a Sorcerer?
How do you know?
No such thing as low-key!
In fact, I am a commissioner dispatched by the prophets to help you. As long as you follow my directions and finish each step, you will definitely be transferred successfully!
Tell me what I should do!
You're a fraud! FRAUD!!!
It is a little bit complicated, but you just have to do it step by step. At first, you should learn to take the cream! <PF>I am not lying to you! The so-called sublimation refers to a sublimation you get from ghosts, and it is usually used by prophets to do battle. Only we celestial masters are able to take the sublimation by dispersing bells! <PF>And that's it for the explanation. Once again though, you should trust me! Totally, you should trust me! In fact, you should do whatever I tell you to! <PF>These are <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>the dispersing bells.</FONT> Take them, and then go to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Spectre Isle</FONT>. Find the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Ditch Swamp Demon, Harpy of the Dark Star, Insane Witch and Hell癒礎s Magician, kill them all, and take the sublimation </FONT>! Remember to spare enough room in your bag so that you can bring the sublimation back. By the way, you should bring at least <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>50 Ghost Sublimation </FONT> for me!
Let's go!
I have to go pack my bags.
I await your good news!
You backpack is full! Please <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>clear it up</FONT> and come back to me! Otherwise I cannot give you the dispersing bells!
This is the only chance you have. Pack quickly and go. Otherwise you will regret it!
Come on! Have you been keeping track of what goes on around you? Have you heard the cries of your relatives? Have you heard information of the most recent lottery drawing? How could we be a fraudulent clan? <PF>Look, this is the badge the prophet gave to me... the twin hand print. I am the mystery public servant of the air! Can you believe me now?
Low-key?  Now that you say so, I have nothing to say.
Come back to me when you achieve a higher level!
When you were killing the monsters, what on earth were you thinking about? How did you feel?
May the Lord Zhixi bless you.
The Soul Master Qiman
Conversation with Qiman
May the Talos bless you!
Now, let me tell you the real task! It has to be you who accomplishes this task! <PF>For a long time, the spirit cohesive energy, which is from the Devil Ice Mirror in the Ice Cave, was lead by the Wand that is used as the cycle motivation to seal the devil. But this time it must be destroyed! We conclusively cannot connect with the guardian force, the Ice Giants. <PF>This is the place where the Wand will most likely appear after the disaggregation of the devil world, because the huge heaven and earth spirits will restore the Wand completely! <PF>Little would one ever think that the plan of the ghost cult is so attuned to reason! The Elders estimate that the Ice Giants have probably already degenerated, and the Wand has already been controlled by the degenerated Ice Giants! Although ghosts cannot destroy the Wand completely, with energetic spirit energy and the degenerated guardian force, it is possible to restore it. <PF>However, in order to find the Demon Chamber of the Ice Giants, there are two conditions you must abide by! The first one is to obtain the blessings from the five guardian totems; the second is to find the Colored Transfer Crystal in the deep cave! These two conditions can hardly be accomplished at the same time! <PF>That is because it is really difficult to ask a Soul Master who was just transferred from the Mesmer to go to the deep cave and seek the Colored Transfer Crystal, much less save the degenerated Ice Giants!<PF>Therefore the Elders changed this task, so it is now only when the new comers collect 50 Heaven Flowers, kill all of the Mega Griffins, and kill the Instantly Frozen Lizard Man with their partner that they can obtain the blessings from totems! <PF>There is also time enough to identify the souls of the Heaven Flowers, the Mega Griffins and the Instantly Frozen Lizard Man, practice the skill of transposition, and move through the Colored Transfer Crystals in the Demon Chamber deep underneath the Ice Cave! <PF>Have you completely understood my instructions?

Leave it to me!
I need a partner first!
We are counting on you! Remember not to take action by yourself anymore! Go to the Demon Chamber to release the Ice Giants and bring back the Wand when your partner is prepared!
Yes, it is necessary. Ok, I will wait for you here. When you get ready, tell me. I will practice the skill of transposition for you!
Good! After the two actual practices, I will affirm your ability to combat! I think you can help us! <PF>Do you know the four relics: Holy Blade, Heaven Chain, Wand <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>and Legendary God癒礎s Seal</FONT>? It is said that they were the four relics that the Four Heroes used to seal and lock the devil! <PF>However, with the destruction committed by a human traitor, the place where the four relics were kept was blasted apart and the four relics were disrupted. The devil escaped and led the monsters to do harmful things to the world. <PF>In order to kill monsters, and seal the devil, the four relics must be revived. However, they disappeared after the explosion. As a member of the Secret Cult Society, I will seek the four relics which belong to the Healer Society, and recently I have actually been on to something!
Do you bring good news?
Have you found the seal?
Perhaps. The Elders found something in the records. <PF>Did you know that the Devil Ice Mirror is the origin of the Arctic Tundra, and that the Devil Ice Mirror is located in the Ice Cave? The natural Devil Ice Mirror is able to generate an abundance of spirit energy. The saints used to use the Wand to collect spirit energy in the cave in order to the seal the devil world. <PF>Since the devil world was destroyed, many different accidents have happened in the cave......I even heard that there was some special omen before! <PF>The Guardian Spirit in the cave is used to connect with the Elders at a fixed time through the Devil Ice Mirror. However, from that day when the devil world was destroyed up until now, there has been no news about it for a long time. <PF>The Elders used to dispatch emissaries to seek the Ice Giants, which presumably have hid themselves in the Demon Chamber! <PF>The emissaries never found the entrance, but something strange happened--they apparently were able to see the light of the Wand in the entrance of the cave. <PF>Stranger things have followed one by one. Both incidents should be investigated. In the meantime I must find the entrance of the Demon Chamber. Can you take upon yourself the task of investigating where the Wand is?
Am I able to?
I'd like to have a try!
You can doubt yourself, but don't doubt me! The fact that I asked means that I trust you! I of course know that it is dangerous for you to go to the deep cave now. I didn't mean you should go right now! <PF>Look, forget it. It's my fault that I wasn't thorough. You should listen carefully to what I am going to tell you now! <PF>If I remember everything right, the Devil Ice Mirror could only have been put into the Ice Cave, so that means there must be some certain seal in the cave as well. This is the reason why the Ice Giants were called out to defend the seal! <PF>After we Soul Masters had taken the pretest in in each age, we have had to seek the five totems with five different figures of monsters outside the Arctic Tundra!  The five totems are featured with bears, eagles, wolves, leopards and lions. You should contribute all your powers and get their blessings. <PF>However, not all the totems will bless you. You must remember that only 3 totems will give blessings. It also is said that sometimes only one will give blessings. It depends on your luck!  Receive the blessings, and come back to me. Then I will tell you the relation between them and the cave, and why you should seek the Wand!
Ok, I got it!
Can I start off later?
Go now! May the Four-Armed Goddess bless you!
How pitiful the connoisseur is! When you want to go there, come back to me and I will explain it to you again.
Very good! But it is dangerous for you to go to the deep cave now. I didn't mean you should go right now!

If I remember everything right, the Devil Ice Mirror can only be put in the Ice Cave, so there must be a certain seal in the cave as well. This is the reason why the Ice Giants were called out to defend seal! <PF>After we Soul Masters had taken the pretest in each age, we have had to seek the five totems with five different figures of monsters outside the Arctic Tundra!  The five totems are featured with bears, eagles, wolves, leopards and lions. You should contribute all your powers and get their blessings. <PF>However, not all the totems will bless you. You must remember that only 3 totems will give blessings. It is said that sometimes only one will give blessings. It depends on your luck!  Receive the blessings, come back to me, and then I will tell you the relation between them and the cave, and why you should seek the Wand!
Got it.
Can I start off later?
Go now! May the Four-Armed Goddess bless you!
How pitiful the connoisseur is! When you want to go there, come back to me and I will explain it to you again.
You seem to have mastered the skill to fight with small forces. The following task is more hard combat: Kill the Instantly Frozen Lizard Man. It is not easy to fight with it in the separated room called Flash Freeze Room, and likewise it isn't possible to fight it all by yourself! <PF>Go find some friends. This will test whether your teamwork skills. We, Soul Masters, are not only good at handling various situations, but also good at doing so as a collective work! <PF>But wait, don't hurry off just yet. I nearly forget to tell you that <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>the Colored Transfer Crystals</FONT> <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>for the Flash Freeze Room</FONT> are not located in Snowzone. Rather, they are located on the roadside of the SouthWest region in <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Arctic Tundra</FONT>. If you have prepared yourself, you can go!
Ok, I will go!
Is it necessary?
May Hades Siyu bless you!
Are you doubtful? I just ordered you to do it, but I did not consult with you! If you do not want to transfer, you go be the mesmer!
Ugh! I don't understand why they are giving me another task! I'm just an examiner! Ok, fine, I take care of this just once! A chocolate made from Heaven Flower Pollen.. (She gives you a haunted smile, which makes you shiver. Is it because it is too cold?)
I feel it is far from good!
It is out of line.
You, an obvious genius, would be an idiot to partake of the chocolate made from Heaven Flower Pollen. Don't worry. Of course you will not eat them. As long as you know the transformation theory of the Soul Master, it will be a piece of cake for you! Therefore, I will let you pass directly!
Ah, how wonderful!
Then I can change class?
Don't be shocked. You just passed the theory. There still are practicals. You have to pass both tests for the ceremony!   (Leon waved her right hand at the sky. She seems to be waving an invisible club in the air.)  See it? Every Soul Master has their way of utilizing their unique auras. The practicals is to let you discover your best way to utilize auras!   We are talking about practicals, so of course you couldn't pass just by listening to me. You have to go to battles! And not just any battles. You have to do a hidden battle!
Hidden battle?
Special battle?
Have you heard of the mysterious monster -- Mega Griffins? According to rumors, you just have to pick his feather. Put it on yourself, and you'd level up!   Don't believe those baseless rumors!   You leveling up because you battled alone against <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>the herd of Mega Griffins</FONT>, and this activates your potential! This has nothing to do with the Griffin's feathers that stick to you during battles!   But the rumor about Mega Griffins being mysterious is true. It is because its lair is in-- <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>the Freezing Chamber</FONT> and is very well hidden and very difficult to find. You need the special <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Teleportation Crystal</FONT> to get there. So there, is my explanation clear enough? I don't need a Griffin feather, and of course you don't either, but if you want to become a Sorcerer, you have to be able to pit yourself against multiple Griffins! <PF>So your next step is: go to the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Snowzone</FONT> and find the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Teleportation Crystal</FONT> to enter the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Freezing Chamber</FONT>, and defeat <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>all Mega Griffins in the lair</FONT>.
Sure, I'll go.
Is that effective?
May the Goddess Nuwo give you her blessing!
You doubt me? I'm telling you to go, no negotiations! If you don't want to change Classes, then stay as an Illusionist for the rest of your life!

You prodigy! For this test, you should have acted as a Flower Mania. You should have eaten the toxic Heavenly Flowers like chocolates. Don't be afraid. Of course you don't have to just throw them in your mouth. As long as you understand the theory of Transformation of Summoners, this test should be a sure win for you! So I'll just give you a pass!
Can I hold transferring?
Ah? You are so kind.
Take it easy! You just passed on theory section. There is also actual practice. Remember, you have to pass them both! (Qiman raises her hand and waves to the sky. It looks like she is holding an invisible stick in her hand) <PF>Did you see that? Every Soul Master has a special way to use their spirit energy, and the actual combat is finding how you can use your spirit energy the most efficiently! The so-called actual combat test is of course not as simple as listening to the explanation surrounding it. This is real combat--not just any ordinary combat, but covert combat!
Covert combat?
Special combat?
Have you heard of a mysterious monster called the Chilly Griffin?  It is said that you are able to achieve a higher level if you pull out one of its feathers and insert it on yourself!    But let me tell you right now that it's all a bunch of nonsense!<PF>You only move to the next level <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>when your potential has been increased.</FONT> It has nothing to do with pulling feathers off of griffins during combat. It is admittedly true that the Chilly Griffins are fairly mysterious because they live hidden in <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>the Freezing Chamber,</FONT> which is a secret place and rather hard to find. One is able to go there by means of the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Colored Transfer Crystals</FONT>. <PF>So did I make myself clear? Neither you nor I need the griffin feathers, but it is only when you are able to fight several griffins at the same time that you can use your own energy most efficiently in this dangerous process. <PF>Therefore, the next step is to find <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>the Colored Transfer Crystals</FONT> in <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Ginkotsu Snowfield</FONT> in order to go to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>the Freezing Chamber</FONT> and kill <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>all the Chilly Griffins</FONT>.

Does it really work?

I had a dream that I traveled somewhere! It was both dangerous and interesting!
The Sorcerer Yessen
Character?level: 70
Conversation with Yessen
May Biyofily manifest herself through you!
Congratulations on having passed the two-stage tests! Now, let me tell you the final test for becoming a Sorcerer! Do not be afraid! Listen carefully!  Do you know the four relics: Holy Blade, Heaven Chain, Wand <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>and Legendary God癒礎s Seal</FONT>? It is said that they were the four relics that the Four Heroes used to seal and lock up the devil! <PF>However, with the destruction committed by a human traitor, the place where the four relics were kept was blasted apart and the four relics were disrupted. The devil escaped and led monsters do harmful things to the world. In order to kill monsters and seal the devil back up, the four relics must be revived. However, they disappeared after the explosion.    As a member of the Secret Cult Society, I will seek the four relics which belong to the Healer Society, and recently I have actually been on to something!
Do you bring good news?
Have you found the seal?
Perhaps. The Elders found something in the records. <PF>Did you know that the Devil Ice Mirror is the origin of the Arctic Tundra, and that the Devil Ice Mirror is located in the Ice Cave? The natural Devil Ice Mirror is able to generate an abundance of spirit energy. The saints used to use the Wand to collect spirit energy in the cave in order to seal the devil world. <PF>Since the devil world was destroyed, many different accidents have happened in the cave......I even heard that there was some special omen before! The Guardian Spirit in the cave is used to connect with the Elders at a fixed time by Devil Ice Mirror, however, from the day since when the devil world was destroyed up until now, there has been no news about it for a long time. <PF>The Elders used to dispatch emissaries to seek the Ice Giants, which presumably have hid themselves in the Demon Chamber! The emissaries have never found the entrance, but something strange happened--they apparently were able to see the light of the Wand in the entrance of the cave!
Get to the point!
Rush and get them back?
Take it easy. Just hear me out! <PF>For a long time it was the spirit cohesive energy from the Devil Ice Mirror in the Ice Cave that was led by the Wand which is used as the cycle motivation to seal the devil. But this time it must be destroyed! We conclusively cannot connect with the guardian force, the Ice Giants. <PF>This is the place where the Wand will most likely appear after the disaggregation of the devil world, because the huge heaven and earth spirits will restore the Wand completely! <PF>Little would one ever think that the plan of the ghost cult is so attuned to reason! The Elders estimate that the Ice Giants may have already degenerated and that the Wand has already been controlled by the degenerated Ice Giants! <PF>Although ghosts cannot destroy the Wand completely, with energetic spirit energy and the degenerated guardian force, it is possible to restore it. <PF>Have you completely understood everything I have said? This is your last test to go to the Ice Cave, purify the degenerated Ice Giants and recapture the Wand!
Am I able to?
I'd like to have a try!
Of course I know it is dangerous for you to go to the cave now! But do you still remember how to go to the Freezing Chamber? The Colored Transfer Crystal is a fantastic treasure. It will not be difficult to send you to the Demon Chamber with it, not to mention delivering the skills of the Sorcerer. <PF>However, limited by my own power, I can only send the Colored Transfer Crystals to the underground through the spiritual power in the Ice Cave. <PF>Therefore, you just need to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>find the Colored Transfer Crystal underneath the Ice Cave</FONT>, and then you will be able to enter into the Demon Chamber to purify the Ice Giants and recapture the Wand!
I need a partner first!
Leave it to me!
Yes, it is necessary. Ok, I will wait for you here. When you are prepared, let me know and I will explain it to you again!
We are counting on you! I will go with you if the Colored Transfer Crystal is able to send the spell caster!  Remember not to take action by yourself, but only when your partner is prepared. <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Enter the Demon Chamber to purify the Ice Giants and recapture the Wand</FONT>!
Good. You should be confident in yourself! I know it is dangerous for you to go to the deep cave now! But do you still remember how to go to the Freezing Chamber?  The Colored Transfer Crystal is a fantastic treasure. It will not be difficult to send you to the Demon Chamber with it, much less the delivering skill of a Sorcerer. <PF>However, limited by my power, I can only send the Colored Transfer Crystal to the underground with the spiritual power in the Ice Cave. <PF>Therefore, you just need to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>find the Colored Transfer Crystal underneath the Ice Cave</FONT>, and then you will be able to enter into the Demon Chamber to purify the Ice Giants and recapture the Wand!
Let me go find comrades!
Okay, let me do it!
Umm, this is indeed necessary. Alright, I will wait for you right here. Let me know when you are ready to go, I will then explain to you one more time.
Then I will leave it to you! If not for the fact that the Teleportation Crystal couldn't teleport the spell caster, I would have gone with you!   Remember, when you find it, don't barge in by yourself. Wait until your comrades are ready before <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>entering the Demon Chamber to purify the Ice Golem and retrieve the Spirit Staff</FONT>!
If I could go myself, I would have gone already! Well, don't be hasty. Let me finish!   From the beginning of time, the Spirit Staff guides the Ice Mirror in the Ice Cave to concentrate spiritual power. This fuels the cycles of the seal that locks up the Wicked King's body. Now that the seal breaks, I think this location is damaged as well! This could be seen by our inability to communicate with the guardian angel Ice Golem. And this is the spot where the Spirit Staff is most probable to appear after the seal breaks, because the unsurmountable amount of spiritual energy in this spot can most efficiently repair the Spirit Staff!   We didn't think that the demon could devise such a meticulous plan! The elders believe that the Ice Golem has fallen, and the holy artifact Spirit Staff is controlled by the demons through the fallen Ice Golem!  Although the demons could not completely destroy the Spirit Staff, the unsurmountable amount of spirit force and the fallen guardian angel could turn the artifact into an object of evil. This is very probable! <PF>Now you you have some idea about the whole story? So my last test for you is: Go to the Ice Cave. Purify the Ice Golem and retrieve the Spirit Staff!
Am I capable enough?
I am willing to try!
I certainly know that the depths of the Ice Cave is full of danger! But you still remember how to get to the Flash Freeze Room?  The Teleportation Crystal is an amazing treasure. Together with the teleportation skills of us Soul Masters, sending you to the Demon Chamber shouldn't be too difficult. But due to the limitation on my powers, I could only borrow the power of the dispersing aura, and place the Teleportation Crystal on the First Floor, I couldn't teleport at will. So you only need <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>to find the Teleportation Crystal in the Ice Cave B1</FONT>, to enter the Demon Chamber to purify the Ice Golem and retrieve the Spirit Staff!
Let me go find comrades!
Okay, let me do it!

Not yet, but the elders found traces in the scrolls. You know the Ice Cave in the Arctic Tundra. Artic Tundra is born from the Ice Mirror and the Ice Mirror is within the Ice Cave. Born between heaven and earth, the Ice Mirror can concentrate a large amount of icy aura. The saints used the Sprit Staff to guide the aura from the Ice Mirror in the Demon Chamber, and used it to create the seal. When the seal that locks up the Wicked King broke, a lot of strange things happened in the ice cave... I've even heard that there were omens even before the breaking of the seal!   Before the destruction of the seal, the guardian angel in the Ice Cave--The Ice Golem will use the Mirror to contact the elders. But ever since the seal broke, we have no news from him. The elders have sent messengers to find the Ice Golem, but none of them found him. The Ice Golem seems to have hidden the entry to the Demon Chamber!   Messengers who toiled to find the entry couldn't find it, but they<PF>discovered an odd thing--they said they saw the halo from the Spirit Staff in the cave!
What about the test!
Then hurry to get it back!
Don't be hasty. Let me finish!   From the beginning of time, the Spirit Staff guides the Ice Mirror in the Ice Cave to concentrate spiritual power.

This is very probable! <PF>Now you you have some idea about the whole story? So my last test for you is: Go to the Ice Cave. Purify the Ice Golem and retrieve the Spirit Staff!
Am I capable enough?
I am willing to try!
I certainly know that the depths of the Ice Cave is full of danger! But you still remember how to get to the Flash Freeze Room?  The Teleportation Crystal is an amazing treasure. Together with the teleportation skills of us Soul Masters, sending you to the Demon Chamber shouldn't be too difficult. But due to the limitation on my powers, I could only borrow the power of the dispersing aura, and place the Teleportation Crystal on the First Floor, I couldn't teleport at will. So you only need <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>to find the Teleportation Crystal in the Ice Cave B1</FONT>, to enter the Demon Chamber to purify the Ice Golem and retrieve the Spirit Staff!
Let me go find comrades!
Okay, let me do it!
Umm, this is indeed necessary. Alright, I will wait for you right here. Let me know when you are ready to go, I will then explain to you one more time.
Then I will leave it to you! If not for the fact that the Teleportation Crystal couldn't teleport the spell caster, I would have gone with you!   Remember, when you find it, don't barge in by yourself. Wait until your comrades are ready before <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>entering the Demon Chamber to purify the Ice Golem and retrieve the Spirit Staff</FONT>!

Congratulations on becoming a Sorceror! I hope you could make more contributions to the High Mage Society in the future!
The world is like a chess board, full of unexpected events. Here we meet again, friend!
Hmm, according to the information we have collected until now and the elders' theory, we have discovered our new target! That's the legendary monster -- <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Young Asura</FONT>!   According to the legends, he was born from the the atmosphere of war. He is an Asura who seeks war throughout his life! Out of all demons, he is the only one who could use the God's Seal!  You know that the God's Seal is the most powerful magical weapon? Because it was used to kill hordes of demons, and was splashed in blood numerous times. That's why it shone blood red. This cruel and violent demon which is destined to live and die in war have something which matches the property of the God's Seal--it's power to kill!  If the God's Seal remain under the influence of Asura's evil aura, it could turn from a holy artifact into an evil weapon, and it could be used by the demon Asura!
Holy artifact is now evil?
What should we do now?
There is such a probability! The five holy sisters said that the aura of the God's Seal lingers, but Asura has disappeared. There is reason in their words. Seems like we no longer have to search in Spectre Station! The most probable spot for the God's Seal to appear is in the Ice Cave in Artic Tundra!   Seems like the chaos on the Tundra and the odd occurences in the Ice Cave are all related to the God's Seal! We have to hurry up and tell the Prophets this bit of news. Ah, right, if I remembered correctly, the chaos on the Tundra was something Liumeu have investigated! Hurry on back! There must be something that she needs your help with!    My missions here are completed. You go on back to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>look for Liumeu</FONT>!
I understand!
Let me rest a while more!
I remembered Liumeu's last message. She said that: a very rare monster appeared on the Artic Tundra - the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Instantly-Frozen Lizard Man</FONT>!   Hehe, don't be afraid, I only need you to go back and <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>report to Liumeu</FONT>! I'm not making you go fight the Instantly-Frozen Lizard Man! However, will Liumeu send you to fight him, I couldn't guarantee. Hahahaha!
Rest? You need more rest? I've already talked for so long, and still you haven't had enough rest?  Fine fine fine, you carry on resting. When you are ready, come talk to me. I will explain to you again.

Why are you still here? Rookies don't report to me here. Head back to Saint Joel to talk to Liumeu.

I'll retrieve the God's Seal!
I'll look for comrades now!

Motel Chef Bamian Basic Conversation
It's you? You've helped me a great deal last time, thanks!
It's you. Thank you for what you've done last time! With the Fire Fruit Jade you brought back last time, our motel's special meal is now so famous that everybody's heard of it. Hahahaha, you really are my lucky star!   Have you heard of the rumors about the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Ripe Fire Fruit</FONT> and the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Ultimate Gourmet Legend</FONT>? I think that could be real deal!  Just a few days ago, I've heard George said that according to botanist Shijen's book Desert Botan Catalogue, there is a legendary treasure which you can use repeatedly -- the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Fiery Fruit</FONT>! He described to me its appearance. It sounds just like what my master told me, the ultimate gourmet ingredient-- <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Ripen Fire Fruit</FONT>!   Are you interested? Although it's an ingredient that exists in the legends, if you can really bring me that...
I don't care for rumors.
Making money?  Of course!
Oh, really? That's a shame. Whenever you are interested, please come back to me.
Although we want to find it, if it's an ingredient from the legends, who knows where to find it? After all, the book is ancient, and those are second hand information. Perhaps its nothing like what we expected.  Ah, you go and <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>ask George</FONT>. Maybe he knows something since he too is a botanist. But don't expect too much. It is a just legend. It can't be trusted completely.
Oh, it's you? Thank you for your help last time! Thanks to the Reformed Fire Fruit which you brought back. We finally sold our deluxe meals to the gourmet. Ah, let me tell you a secret of the monsters in the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Waterfall Tunnel</FONT> as a reward!   You know what those monsters eat? Guess. You're right! Those Spiritual Plant from the Fire Fruit bushes! Why do I say such things? Of course I have proof! Look at this <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Sphere Spiritual Plant</FONT>! This crystalline, jade colored, pearl shaped object is <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>taken from the monsters</FONT>. According to George's analysis, these are seeds of the Fire Fruit. I think monsters are quite smart. They know the nutrients in the seeds. Aside from that, <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>George</FONT> has once created a Fire Fruit Jade! I've tasted it and found it crispy, perfect as a side dish! <PF> Now, you know why I tell you this secret. Of course I hope you could bring some <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Fire Fruit Jade</FONT> back Ah! So, interested?
Okay, let me do it!
Sorry, I am busy.
You know that Sphere Spiritual Plant are taken from monsters from the Waterfall Tunnel. Nobody has been able to find them from the Fire Fruit bushes, so please go <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>defeat more monsters</FONT>. Remember to pass the Sphere Spiritual Plant to George to refine into Fire Fruit Jade. George said that the chances of refining  this plant is much lower than creating other plants. So there's no other way. Please gather more Sphere Spiritual Plants. Right, let me explain this. <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Fire Fruit Jade is not the motel's main dish, so George will take refining costs from you</FONT>. But, as long as you <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>bring me five Fire Fruit Jade</FONT>, I will compensate and reward you. Sorry I have to trouble you like this. Let me say this to you now: <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>thank you for your hard work!</FONT>
Oh, really? That's a shame. Whenever you are interested, please come back to me.
It's you! Thank's for your help last time! Because of the Thorned Fire Fruit you brought back, we don't have to worry about ingredients for a while. Right! Have you been to the depths of the Waterfall Tunnel? I've heard that because the depths of <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Waterfall Tunnel</FONT> is too dangerous, so bushes located there are hardly picked. The fruits there not only turn into Medium Spiritual Plants. They even grow into <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Large Spiritual Plants</FONT>. Large Spiritual Plants can be made into <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Reformed Fire Fruit</FONT>. This is an extremely rare ingredient. If there are more Reformed Fire Fruit, then my deluxe meals can satisfy gourmets that could pay real money. Now, I've explained all this. You should know what I want you to help me with? You're right, I hope  you could <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>bring me some Reformed Fire Fruit</FONT>.So, interested?
Okay, let me do it!
Sorry, I am busy.
Then, please remember to take the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Spiritual Plant Sample</FONT> and reserve enough space  in your back pack. Then enter the depths of the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Waterfall Tunnels</FONT> to find the best quality <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Fire Fruit Bushes</FONT>, and pick the ingredient for the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Reformed Fire Fruit</FONT>-- <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Large Spiritual Plant</FONT>.Even when you find the best quality Fire Fruit bush, you still might not be able to pick the Large Spiritual Plant.

Oh, really? That's a shame. Whenever you are interested, please come back to me.
It's you? Thank's for your help last time! Thanks for the Fresh Fire Fruit you brought back last time. We've finally solved our hunger crisis. Thanks!  Right! Have you been to the depths of the Waterfall Tunnel?  You know what? Because bushes at the entry of the cave are easy to access, they only grow Small Spiritual Plants that could be made into Fresh Fire Fruit. The Spiritual Plants aren't even fully grown before they are picked. So, to pick <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Medium Spiritual Plants</FONT> that could be made into Thorned Fire Fruit, you would have to enter the depths of Waterfall Tunnel.   Compared to the Fresh Fire Fruit, the Thorned Fire Fruit could better bring out the taste of our special meal. But when we get sudden orders, we could only use the accessible Fresh Fire Fruit, you know? Right, now that I've done explaining. You could guess what I wanted you to help with? You're right, I'm asking you to bring me   some <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Thorned Fire Fruit back</FONT>. So, interested?
Okay, let me do it!

Oh, really? That's a shame. Whenever you are interested, please come back to me.
Kind hearted sir, do you have time to help me out?
Yes, what's wrong?
Sorry, not now.
It's just that, lately, there are more travelers coming to the Mirage Oasis. Although more businesses is a good thing for us with motels, the demand on food also increases. This is indeed troubling because when I made our special meals, I didn't only adjust the tastes. The most important thing is the freshness of the ingredients.  The ingredients <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>originates</FONT> from <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Waterfall Tunnel</FONT>, these fruits are hard to pick and the volume of their crop isn't stable. Luckily, I have a stable source of supply - The botanist George. But with this sudden increase in demand, even George tells me that there are not enough gatherers. He can't provide more ingredient in the mean time. After extended negotiations, George said that if someone could help gather raw material of the ingredients for him, he is willing to synthesize them for free. This is an urgent situation that has to be resolved, but I need to cook, I don't have time to spare. So, brave adventurer, are you willing to head to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Waterfall Tunnels</FONT> to gather raw material of ingredients for me?
Okay, let me do it!
Sorry, I'm busy.
Then, please <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>take this Spiritual Plant Illustrated handbook and reserve enough space in your backpack</FONT>. Then head off to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Waterfall Tunnel</FONT> <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>to find</FONT> the place where the ingredients come from <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>--the Fire Fruit Bushes</FONT>, then <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>pick</FONT> the ingredients-- <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Small Spiritual Plant</FONT>. Please try a few more bushes, because not every Fire Fruit bush produces Small Spiritual Plants.   Then bring the Spiritual Plants you picked to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>the Botanist George</FONT> to be made into ingredients. Of course, not every Small Spiritual Plant can be turned into ingredients, so please bring in more.  Lastly, please bring <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>5</FONT> George's <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>products</FONT> <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>to</FONT> my special kitchen helper <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>motel kitchen maid Cortny</FONT>! I believe you will be satisfied with the rewards.
Then, please remember to take the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Spiritual Plant Sample</FONT> and reserve enough space  in your back pack.

Mirage Oasis Antique Evaluationist Size
Antique Evaluationist Size Basic Conversation
It's you? You've helped me a great deal last time, thanks!
It's you. Thank's for helping me last time! In the past days we could only transport gemstones, but because of the unexamined raw stones you brought back to us, now we get into the gemstone extract industry. You truly are my lucky star!   When we are studying ways to extract gemstones, I found a few legends about the mineral rocks in the Sandfall Maze! Have you heard of the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Jewel Pouch</FONT>? That's a very widespread <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>rumor</FONT>. I think that <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>could be real</FONT>!  In the many account books from the business teams, there is information about legendary gemstones, such as their appearance and the locations where they last appear. Among these gems <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>The Emperor's golden jewel--Tear of Meteor</FONT> was last seen in <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>the Sandfall Maze</FONT>!  The team that transported this jewel is the legendary <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Steel Bullet Business Team</FONT>. They used their <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>legendary</FONT> Jewel Pouch <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>-- which could preserve the flawlessness of gemstones,</FONT> to carry the Tear of Meteor. In the Sandfall Maze, they were attacked by unexpected amount of <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>monsters</FONT>. At the end, only one person escaped ! The Tear of Meteor had also disappeared!<PF>Now, are you interested? Since it's a jewel from the legends, if you found it, you'd be rich!
I don't care for rumors.
Making money?  I'm there!
Oh, really? That's a shame. Whenever you are interested, please come back to me.
Remember this is a legendary jewel. Since what's written in the account books happened a long time ago and this is only second hand information, maybe it's not what we think. Ah, you <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>go ask Briton</FONT>. He's a descendent of the Steel Bullet. Maybe he has some information. But don't keep your hopes too high. Gemstones like that only appear when you are extremely lucky!
It's you? Thanks for your help last time! The Cytosine you brought back satisfy our need to meet the great demand for gemstones. Ah, let me tell you <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>the secret in the Sandfall Maze</FONT> as a reward!   The quick sand in the maze is not regular sand. Those sparkling sands are all tiny fragments of gemstones! Sadly, nobody found the mines of these gems. So suddenly, we have an idea!  Hehe, have you seen the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Portable Pouches</FONT> from the monsters in the Sandfall Maze? These little pouches are our team's secret weapon! The pouches are attracted to both gems and minerals!  Guess what I'm trying to say? According to our estimates, those gems that we don't know how to mine are taken by the monsters! So as long as we make the monsters carry our pouches when they mine, and retrieve the pouches from them, then we'd get the gems!  I don't know what the monsters want with the gems, but I know what <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>the gems in the pouches</FONT> are used for! You're right, <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Briton has once extracted an unexamined raw stone from those gems</FONT>!   So, now, you should be able to guess why I'm telling you this secret? Of course I hope you could help us retrieve the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>portable pouches</FONT>. So, interested?
Okay, let me do it!
Sorry, I am busy.
Hehe, actually, I don't know what gems will come out of these unexamined raw stones, but I believe they are very rare! You, too know that <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>only portable pouches from the monsters in the Sandfall Maze</FONT> are valuable, so please <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>defeat more monsters</FONT>. Remember to give Briton the pouches to extract raw stones. According to Briton, the success rate of extracting gems from these pouches are much lower than extracting from normal pouches, so please collect more. Right, let me explain to you first. <font COLOR=#00ff00>Since unexamined raw stones are not transported by the team, Briton will charge you extraction costs</FONT>. However, as long as you <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>bring me five raw stones</FONT>, I will compensate and reward you.  Sorry for giving you so much trouble. Let me say this in advance.<font COLOR=#00ff00>Thank you for your hard work!</FONT>
Oh, really? That's a shame. Whenever you are interested, please come back to me.
It's you. Thank's for helping me last time! Thanks to the Topaz you brought back last time, our repulation is rescued. Thank you!, Right! Have you been to the extreme depths of the Sandfall Maze?   I've heard that <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>in the extreme depths of the Sandfall Maze</FONT> is very dangerous, and because of this, it's scattered with rare valuables that business teams left behind, you might even find <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>the Pouches of Raw Stones</FONT> which could contain Cytosine. After the last incident, a lot of noblemen value our services, and placed orders for some even rarer gems! That's Cytosine, what I've talked to you about! Every crisis is a chance! The market is filled with business opportunities!  So, now, you should be able to guess what I hoped you could help with? Of course, I hope you could <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>bring us Cytosine</FONT>. So, interested?
Okay, let me do it!
Sorry, I am busy.
Then, after clearing space in the back pack, please head to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>the extreme depths of the Sandfall Maze</FONT>, <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>to find the Pouch of Raw Stone</FONT> <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>among the rare valuables lost in the depths</FONT>. Please look in many areas, since you might not find these Raw Stone Pouches in every spot.  After you found the Pouch of Raw Stone, please take them to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Briton to extract</FONT> into gemstones.Of course, he might not be able to extract Cytosine from every Pouch of Raw Stone, since the seal on the pouches might be unrepairably damaged, so please bring back as much pouches as you can.  Lastly, remember to take <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>5 of</FONT> Briton's <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>extracted Cytosine</FONT> to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>to</FONT> the team's Evaluationist <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Anz</FONT>! He is desperate for these gemstones. I believe he will reward you handsomely.

It's you. Thank's for helping me last time! Thanks to the Jaspers you brought back last time, our team's crisis is resolved. Thanks! Right! Have you been to the depths of the Sandfall Maze?  You know, since the entry is more accessible, the goods left behind by other teams are all scavenged. It's real lucky that you can still find square pouches that can be extracted into Jaspers. <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>To find Oval Pouches that can be extracted into Topaz, you have to enter the depths of the Sandfall Maze</FONT>. Compared to Jaspers, Topaz is our main money maker. However, during emergencies, we had to settle on Jaspers, right? So, now, you should be able to guess what I hoped you help with? Of course, I hope you could <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>bring us some Topaz</FONT>.
Okay, let me do it!

Kindhearted sir, do you have time to help out?
Tell me your troubles
Sorry, I'm not interested.
The matter at hand is this. Our business team travels from town to town to trade jewels. This is our main livelihood. We used to travel through the Heavenly Shrine, Cursed Desert, go over the Sandfall Maze, pass the Deadlock Dessert to the Mirage Oasis. This used to be our main route for profit, but lately, there's a huge problem!  The route has never been tranquil. There are monster attacks and such, but with our bodyguards and guides, we were still able to deliver our goods. However, there are massive accidents around the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Sandfall Maze</FONT>, although most of our members escaped, the goods we have to deliver are lost. This is our team's crisis!  As merchants, we can't go looking for our goods ourselves, so we hired <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Sand Fountain Antique Leader Briton</FONT> to help. In this emergency situation, we'd settle for <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Square Pouches</FONT> that hold <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Jaspers</FONT> from the spot where our team was attacked in the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Sandfall Maze</FONT>!  But Briton said that he has to ensure the safety of other teams, so he can't send everyone out to search for us. Since they don't have enough people, they couldn't be of much help in the mean time.  After extended negotiations, Briton said that if someone could assist with the search for the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Square Pouches</FONT> for him, he is willing to unseal the pouches and extract the gems for us. This is an emergency that has to be resolved immediately, but we are just merchants...  So, brave adventurer, are you willing to search <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Sandfall Maze</FONT> for us?
Okay, let me do it!

It's you? Haha, thanks to you, the Jewel Pouch became our team's treasure!
It's you? You've been of great help to our team, thanks.
It's you? Thanks to the Cytosine you brought us. No matter how great the nobleman's demands on gemstones, it's no longer a challenge.
It's you? Thanks to the Topaz you brought us, it's a great help in stabilizing the source of gemstones.

According to legends, <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Thunder Hill</FONT> is where the monsters are sealed. It's filled with odd natural phenomena. The howl of the monsters creates thunder, their anger shines red, their tears of sorrow formed into lakes.<PF>Those who advocate Black Magic - <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>the secret religion</FONT> and those interested in controlling heaven and earth - <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>the Natural</FONT> study magic and draw the aura of the place. They are obsessed with the place and linger around here. As time goes by, this place becomes <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>the origin of Mages and Shamans</FONT>.
Then what about Saint Joel?
<font COLOR=#00ff00>Saint Joel</FONT> is located on the icy Northern lands. The areas around it is filled with crystal mines, so it became popular with the craftsman of the Science Culture.

Located in Death Valley is <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Mystique Pyramid</FONT>. It is the resting place of Nam's Pharoah, a man who worships the evil goddess Bestet; it is also the legendary place where the Four Heroes defeated and sealed Bestet.<PF>To ensure that the seal would not be broken by Nam's descendents, throughout history, protectors of the secret religion guarded the seal, sent people to patrol the grave and instill new aura into the seal. On the other hand, the grave holds Nam's treasure. That's why a lot of adventurers go there. What about you? Do you want to go?

On the Cursed Desert, there stands a very famous <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Underworld Castle</FONT>. The place is famous for the Underground rooms that contain treasure chests.

It's a place in the Death Valley where the icy water from the Northern mountains collect in to small ponds. Even in the ancient times, it's an oasis where people settle.

Sandfall Maze is a natural cave. The tunnels spread out in the shape of a spider web and spreads into all sorts of caves. Since it's under the desert, you'd see torrents of sand pouring down above your head. That's how the name came by. This is also one of the most popular routes traveling merchants take, but since quick sand and caves are everywhere, it's very easy to get lost in. A lot of merchant groups fall into these traps and disappear completely. I've heard that a lot of valuable shipments get left behind there.

Amethyst Cave is located in the south of the Snowzone. This cave is filled with a special amethyst powe. The power in the depths of the cave is so great that their energy forms a pale purple mist. The power causes change in the crystals and make them glow a purplish red. The scenery in the cave is a must-see. It's a world completely in purple.  The Transparent Crystals in these caves are more than pretty. They are famous for being able to turn into power stones.

When the snow on the Sacred Hilltop melts in the summer, the water flows donw and it forms a waterfall. The Waterfall Tunnel was formed behind this waterfall. The Waterfall Tunnel is a bridge that connects the Ice Fields and the Desert. The water plummets down the cliffs thoughout the year and keeps this place moist. The caves are filled with lakes and plants that grow in water.  It's beautiful with all the plants there, but it's so damp and cold. The Waterfall Tunnel could've been another Mirage Oasis if it wasn't so cold. By the way, I heard the deluxe meal in the famous Mirage Oasis hotel uses the Fire Fruit from the Waterfall Tunnels as its main ingredient.

Basic Conversation Inventor Tima
Thank you! Thanks to you the security completed many quests. Maybe one day you can join them.
Young one, you've changed so much since we last met. The experiences you must  have had! I was actually just having a dilemma, and suddenly you showed up. You must be my savior. So, do you want to help me out?
Sure! I love helping!
No. I'm a mean person.
That's my boy! Have you heard of the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Ice Cave</FONT>? It's really far from here. It's in a far away <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>continent</FONT>, and you can only get there by taking the dangerous  <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Ekomi Railroad</FONT>, but the Meteor Pit remote security force was called to go there.<PF>Because monsters are getting out of control all over the world, the old mystical powers have diminished, and the Ice Cave is getting weaker and weaker. So the remote security force was called out there. But since they weren't used to the environment, they couldn't use their usual weapons. The leader Kamyu was told to make research on weapons that would work there.<PF>I'm old now, and I would have trouble just getting to the Ice Cave, let alone standing the cold weather. I have some plans for the weapons in my head, but I would need to use minerals from the area to light them. At the ice cave, I hear there is plenty of <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Ice Crystal Stone</FONT>. I was wondering if you could collect the Crystal Stones for me. I don't even know how to collect them, so go ask around at <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>San Joel</FONT>. San Joel is the closest city to Ice Cave, and it's the center for us Warriors and Scientist, so I'm sure it'll be alright.
You young people these days... You really don't respect your elders.
Thank you! Thanks to you, the lives of our villagers will be saved.
It's been a while, young one. It looks like you've gotten stronger. I have a dangerous mission that I need to ask of you. It may even be deadly. But there is nobody else I can trust, so will you please listen to my plea?
What is the mission?
I think I sprained my ankle...
You really are brave, young one! You truly deserve my trust. There are some monsters that have been ravaging this area. Recently, when villagers go to the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Holy Plains to the South East</FONT>, they've been attacked by a monster called the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Demonic Edge</FONT>.<PF>Strangely, none of them had any injuries but all seemed as though they had their souls taken. The villagers have asked us to investigate the cause of this. This truly is a dangerous mission, so I will understand if you refuse to help. I can't guarantee you would survive...
I want to test my strength
My life is important to me!
Wonderful! I knew I saw something in you. I thank you on behalf of all the villagers. In order to study this strange occurrence, we first need to collect these things called  <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Shred of Sword</FONT>. I believe that the memory and energy of fallen <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Demonic Edge</FONT> get inscribed in those shreds.<pf>In order to analyze them, we will need <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>50</FONT> of them. Please collect them for the villagers!
Thank you for listening. I can understand you value your life. I don't blame you. Don't worry, I'll think of another way.
Okay... I got it! It's too dangerous, and I can't ask you every time.
Young one, it's been a while. How have you been?
Young one, we meet again! How have you been? I'm glad you're looking good. I actually have a favor to ask of you. Is that okay?
You can ask me anything.
I have other things to do
Young one, thank you very much. My friend <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Entarokov</FONT> went to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Spiritual Land</FONT> to look for the Flower of Line Color</FONT>, but I haven't heard from him since. He was sick, and I think he would be running out of medication about now.<PF>There are many monsters in <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Spiritual Land</FONT>, so I have been debating if I should ask somebody to help. Do you think you can deliver him some medication? Of course, you will be rewarded for this.
Not a problem
That sounds difficult
Thank you very much. There are many monsters there, so please be careful!
Oh, you item inventory is full. Please sort it out and come back to me.
Okay, this is a dangerous job, so I'll ask somebody else.
I'll ask others then.
Young one, how have you been?
Judging from your clothes, it looks like you really need money. I got a job to give out, so do you want to help out? Of course, you will be rewarded for this.
Sure
I'm not interested
Excellent! Well then, please deliver this milk to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>MacMaster, Ofilia, and Wiyu</FONT>. Just get it to them <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>before the expiration date</FONT>. No problem, right?
Easy as pie!
That's pointless
Thank you so much!
Oh, your item inventory is full. Please sort it out and come back to me.
There really aren't many people who'd do a menial task like this, huh. Young ones these days...! Well, I'm sorry for taking your time - I'll ask somebody else.
That's a shame! These days it's hard just to find any decent people. I'm sorry for taking your time - I'll ask somebody else.
Young one, the future is on your shoulders!
Basic Conversation Adventurer MacMaster
Would you like to here my story? Long ago, I survived 3 whole years on a deserted island with only a knife! Back then, all I could eat to survive were fruits and vegetables. With my courage and knowledge, I managed to make a raft and escape that island. Everybody called me The Great Adventurer MacMaster. And just recently I managed to travel all the way around the world!
Really?
No way!
You probably think I'm lying! When I escaped from that island, I made three good friends. It was thanks to them that I was able to travel around the world. They're all traveling the world right now, but I can't help thinking of them. It's almost as if I'm still with them.<pf>I even feel as if we can go on another adventure some day. That reminds me of the first adventure I had in my childhood...
As a kid?
I'm sorry, I'm busy
It was when I first entered the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Plague Dungeon</FONT> as a kid. I was only three back then. I fought a <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Ghost of Vengeance</FONT> for three whole days. I received the title The Invincible MacMaster for that. The villagers all worshipped me, and I received countless titles!   I received about 3678 titles!
That's so impressive!
That's such a lie!
*cough cough* I'm thirsty. I've been talking about my life story for 5 days, and I'm still  not finished. I'm sure I could write 36 books just about my life alone. If you're free some time, I can tell you each one! If you want to be amazing like me, you'll need to work a lot harder!
Phew! I'm a little tired now. If you want to hear more, come over whenever you want, or you can wait until I finish writing my books. I'm writing a 36 book series of The Adventures of the Brave and Great Warrior  MacMaster. There will be 12 chapters, with 3 books per chapter. I'm try to get them published next year, so keep your eyes open for it!
It seems that you are busy now. That's ok. I love sharing my experiences with others. So feel free to come along whenever you're free.
Wow, you don't believe me? I have a grand total of 45712 stories. If you're interested, just come over whenever you want!
Basic Conversation Housewife Ofilia
I'm praying for the safety of my husband.

I'll come later.
Yes yes yes! I'm so happy! I heard from a patroller from Meteor Pit 3 days ago that somebody who looked like my husband was at <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Corpse Church to the North East</FONT>. Can you send him my regards? Although I'm not sure if it's actually my husband...
Leave it to me!
I have other quests...
You'll really help me? Thank you! You're always so good to me! I wish I could repay you somehow. Well, send this letter to him please. All I can do is think about him! Oh, I almost forgot to tell you! My husband's name is <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Solkov</FONT>. Thank you so much!
I know you're a hard worker, but I think your bag is full... Come back after you've cleaned it out a bit! I'll be waiting!
That's okay! Go do whatever you need to do. I'll try asking around.
No problem!
I'm so worried about my husband who's been gone for so long. I haven't heard back from him for a while, so I was wondering how he is now. If you meet him, please tell him that his wife has been keeping the house safe for him.
It's been a while! Did you miss the smell of my homemade cakes?
I can never forget that taste
I just happened to walk by...
Thank you! I actually learned how to bake cakes from Wiyu! She is young, but is very skilled. She lost her parents as a child, so she had to cook for herself. On top of that, her brother is very weak, so she had to think about ingredients and nutrition. She's such a good kid! I actually like her a lot. I really want to find her a suitable partner, since she's been through so much, losing her parents and taking care of her brother all alone. She says she's not interested, but I think she's just worried about her brother.
Is there anything I can do?
Sorry, I'm busy.
I'm planning things out right now. Of course, I'm curious how Wiyu actually feels about the whole thing. Next month is my birthday, so I'm going to hold a small party. I'm holding the party to thank all my friends who've been so good to me, and I want to give Wiyu an opportunity to meet more people. Of course, she might already be interested in somebody, but I figure it couldn't hurt, right?
That sounds great.
I don't know about that...
Really? Well then, time to execute my plan! <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Hikaro</FONT> is very knowledgeable, and <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Roarin</FONT> is a talented artist. I want to hear their opinions on my plan. Do you think you can go ask for their opinion? I can't do this all on my own...
Am I trying too hard? I guess love is something that should just take its own course.
If you're busy, that's fine! Young one, I wish you the best of luck!
Aww, you're blushing. That's cute~
Oh! Young one, the cake in the oven smells great, doesn't it?  Thanks to you, it's going to be the best cake!  I love the smell of fresh baked cakes! It makes me forget all my troubles. Ah.. I just wish I could send this cake to him too...
Him? Who?
I don't think so
Him? Hahaha, it's my husband <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Solkov</FONT>. He left 7 years ago to fullfill his dreams, but he never came back. He said that, as a man, he had to follow his dreams and goals. I was scared when I heard he wanted to go out there. I still can't believe he's gone. Everyday, I keep thinking he'll be back the next day. I still have plenty of suitors, but I want to keep our house safe until he comes back. I feel like it's a wife's duty to protect her husband. People may call me silly, but that's what I believe!
That's so touching!
Don't blame yourself
You understand? Okay, I'm going to stop my story here or else I might start crying... Oh! My cake should almost be ready. Wait just one second... Can you deliver this cake to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Roarin, Hikaro, and Wiyu</FONT> and tell them thanks for everything? This is just a token of gratitude for them, since they're so good to me... <PF><FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Roarin</FONT> should probably be near the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>lake</FONT>. He truly is a talented artist, but unfortunately  he's very shy and missed several chances to become successful. I'm sure you know who <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Hikaro</FONT> is! He's usually at the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Bar</FONT>. And <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Wiyu</FONT> lives in her <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>house to the south east.</FONT>. Off you go! I'll reward you later.
Your bag is full. Clean it out and come back to me later.
Do you understand me? I guess it's not something a young one like you would  understand. I'm sorry, please let me be alone.
You didn't notice this strong smell? You either have horrible taste, or your sense of smell is messed up! You should go to  the doctors. Come back after you've gotten a check up!
I see you running around in such a hurry, did something happen?
Not particularly
I've been so busy lately!
Yes yes, I see a great future in your eyes! If I weren't married, I would want to marry somebody reliable like you!
That's suspicious
That's a little weird!
You're a sharp one. I'm always cooking and I can't go anywhere. While cooking, I need to constantly adjust the fire, and I can't really leave here. But I'm missing two ingredients to make a tasty cake. One is a seasonal favorite, <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Aged Wine</FONT>, and the other is <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Cream</FONT>.<PF>I think you can find <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Aged Wine</FONT> if you go to my friend <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Hikaro</FONT>'s place. He's a merchant that just recently moved here, but he's very knowledgeable about Sake. He was an alcohol taster for 10 years before he became a merchant. He would probably have some tasty Sake. He often goes to the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Tavern</FONT>.<PF>You can probably get <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Cream</FONT> from <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Wiyu</FONT>. She studies cooking a lot. Her house is to the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>South East</FONT>. Could you please get these two ingredients for me?
Of course
Sorry, I'm busy~
Thank you! If I can gather the ingredients, I can make a tasty cake. Just imagining it will make you drool.
You have other things to do? Oh well, it's my fault I'm missing ingredients anyway. I don't want to inconvenience you or anything, so go ahead.
Young ones these days are so suspicious. You think I have an ulterior motive even when I compliment you. I wonder if there will ever come a world where we could all trust  each other? It's okay! Just go away.
Okay, good luck! Work hard while you're young! Once you turn old, all you can do is regret. Alright, now go!
You want to date me too? I'm sorry. I'm married. My husband is a brave voyager, and he's currently out of town. I'm so  sorry!

It's been 3 months since John was called to the Plague Dungeon.<PF>I don't know how his mission is going, but I doubt he can eat any good food or even rest well there.<PF>So I made him a special nutrient filled meal. Could you take it to him?
No problem
I'm a little bit busy...
Thank you so much! I'm so sorry for being such a nuisance. This is the meal I want you to deliver to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Johns</FONT>. He should currently be running his mission at <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Plague Dungeon</FONT>.
Please sort out your bag. You can't carry it like this.
If you don't want to, I'll ask somebody else.
Kaiyu went missing again. I don't know where he went.<PF>He has a weak body, and he keeps getting ill since he was a kid. Kaiyu's always dreamed of travelling the world and becoming an adventurer like  MacMaster. He probably went to MacMaster's place again and is listening to his stories.<PF>All the villagers say to avoid him, and we all don't trust him.<PF>But Kaiyu really likes MacMaster... I really wish he wouldn't worry me so much...
What to do, what to do.
What happened?
Ignore
Eh? Oh, it's you. This time it's a personal issue. I've actually been debating what to do for a while. I have a friend named Gerute who is on the frontlines of the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Fourth Brigade of the Meteor Pit Security Force</FONT>.<pf>Last week, he was called to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Plague Dungeon</FONT>. The monsters there are known to be cruel and very strong. <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Ulay</FONT>, upon hearing this, told me to hurry and give him this <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Protection Spell</FONT> as soon as possible.
Got it!
So what?
You'll go for me? You're such a kind person...<PF>Oh yes! Just tell Gelute about Ulay, but don't mention me.<PF>That way, I'll be able to follow my friend's request and allow Gerute to continue his mission. What do you think?
That sound flawless
Any better ideas?
Well then, let's do it! <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Gerute</FONT> is currently at <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Plague Dungeon to the North East</FONT>.<PF>Even I don't know the details, but you might be able to find some things by asking <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Johns</FONT>. Johns is the Brigade Leader of the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Plague Dungeon Aid Force, Seventh Brigade</FONT>.<PF>Also, Gerute is Johns' Lieutenant. If you find Johns first, you should be able to find out where Gerute is.<PF>And you should be able to save some time too. It'll be full of danger, so be careful.
Please sort out your bag. You can't carry it like this.
...I need to think this over!
Emotional things are so complicated. I didn't want to have anything to do with this but... I just had to.
This is a personal thing, and I can't always ask you for help, I guess.

I really wish he wouldn't worry me so much...
Great, I finally found you. Do you remember me?
What happened?
You are?
I found something very surprising when I was cleaning the house. You might remember when I said I was saved by a very king person before.<PF>That person was a cook, and I learned from him. So he was in a way my master.<PF>I only studied for a short while so I'm not very skilled, but I learned enough for day to  day cooking. Anyway, I found my notes from back then.<PF>It has many cooking tips written inside. I want to take up cooking again... Do you want to help me?
How can I help?
I'm busy
One of the spices listed in my notes makes any food so much better with just a few sprinkles. If you succeed, you can be the first to try it.<PF>However, the recipe to make that spice is incredibly difficult, and might even be  life-threatening. Do you still want to help?
I will go for it!
On second thought...
To make that spice, we need a vegetable called <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Lazulites</FONT>. Lazulites are star shaped plants that grow in high areas, whose flowers can be turned  into spices, and whose seeds can be turned into Lazuline Oil.<PF>However, as Umbra invade more and more of the world, the Lazuline habitat has  diminished little by little. Fortunately, Forest Sickle Weasels love these flowers. You might be able to find some from the defeated <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Forest Sickle Weasels</FONT>. <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Forest Sickle Weasels</FONT> appear in <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Holy Plain</FONT>.<PF>Could you go collect <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>20 Lazuline Flowers</FONT> please?
That's fine, we can wait until I do some more research. I wouldn't want you to get hurt anyway.

Thank you so much for helping me the other day. Without your help, I don't know where I would be now. I would really appreciate if you helped me again, but you seem rather busy.
I'm not too busy
Do I really look busy?
I don't know how to word this properly, especially after being saved by you once already.<PF>But I really have no one else to turn to. Could you please help me out once again?
Sure
I'm sorry. I'm busy now.
I have a friend named <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Ulay</FONT>. Last month she went to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Thunder Hill</FONT>.<PF>I heard she was attacked by monsters earlier and was severely injured. I am her best friend.<PF>However, I need to tend to my brother at Meteor Pit. So here is my request: Can you go tell her that I am worried about her?
Okay
I'm sorry
Really? Thank you so much! Simply cooking you some food would not show how thankful I am.<PF>I think I will cook an entire feast to thank you. Anyway, please give this package to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Ulay</FONT>.<PF>Be careful - you'll probably encounter many monsters on your way.
Please sort out your bag. You can't carry it like this.
Okay, there may be danger lurking throughout your path. I'm so sorry, but you're my only hope.
No, please don't apologize. I'm sorry for asking too much of you.
Especially? You especially care about Kaiyu's health? Thank you so much.<PF>To think that you'd come visit again, even after we troubled you so much last time... Thank you so much. You truly are such an amazing person.

What disease?
Be careful
Long story short, before we lived in Meteor Pit,  we lived in a little <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Wharf</FONT> by the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Ocean to the South East.</FONT><PF>When I was 6, we were attacked by monsters, and as a result, my parents gave their lives to let me and my brother escape on a boat.<PF>At the time, Kaiyu was still only 2. Fortunately, we were saved by some kind people.<PF>I don't even know how long we were drifting on the sea. That may be the reason Kaiyu is so weak.
Has he seen a doctor?
Watch your health as well.
Of course I took him to a doctor! In fact, I took him to some of the best doctors around, but they couldn't do anything.<PF>Even the top doctor for the Meteor Field Security Force, Doctor Fiya, didn't know what to do.<PF>According to Doctor Fiya, there were several causes, including the trauma he had as a child from drifting on the ocean, which continues to slowly weaken his body.<PF>On top of that, he was very ill when he was 4. We still don't know the cause of that illness.<PF>Because of that, he is in constant pain if he doesn't take medication. Oh, right, it's time for Kaiyu to drink his medicine. Can you go find <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Kaiyu</FONT>?<PF>I need to boil the medicine right now. I think Kaiyu is out visiting MacMaster.
Taking care of Kaiyu is the number one priority in my life. I would do anything to help him.
Yes. That's why I spend all my time worring about Kaiyu.

Leave me alone!
Basic Conversation Artist Roarin
Somebody saw Ofilia's husband the other day? Is this true?
Of course!
No, I was kidding
Was it really him? Ofilia must be so happy! She hadn't seen him for 7 years. She needs to teach him a lesson when he comes back!
I'm about to go check
That's none of your business!
I heard he was seen at <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Corpse Church</FONT>. That place is very dangerous, especially because <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Sir Vampire King</FONT> shows up there. There are plenty of people who form parties to fight him, but nobody ever succeeds. If you meet that baron and think you can't win, you need to run away!.<pf>I think Ofilia would feel terrible if you get injured while doing something for her. So be careful, and come back safely!
True, it really has nothing to do with me. But I've known Ofilia since when she was so small... I really want somebody to take care of her, and I want him to finish my job for  me... Ooh, sorry, that has nothing to do with you, so don't worry about it. This is my own personal problem. I really wish Solkov would come back sometimes~, I'm so worried about Ofilia.
Oh, it was a lie? That's a shame. Ofilia was looking forward to him coming back so much...
Personal portraits, personal portraits! An excellent choice for your own collection or as a gift! If you put a portrait up in your house, your life will improve along with your artistic sense. First come first serve! As a 3rd anniversary gift, if you buy 3, I will give you one for free! Why don't you bring your lover and have a portrait drawn of you as proof of your love? How about you? Please buy one!
Is it that good?
You are not a true artist!
Dear customer, these portraits contain so much emotion that your far away lovers and  relatives will be able to feel your presence as though you were right there with them. Anyway, a good piece of art will evoke such emotions in everybody! Do you get it?
No, not really
What a liar!
If anything catches your eye, feel free to ask me about it. Of course, you can also ask for a personal portrait.
You've never been in contact with true art, have you?! Being near the arts will change the way you think. But don't worry, different people have different ideas of beauty. So I understand that not everybody would like my creations. If anything catches your eyes, feel free to ask though.
......
Maybe I went too far
Bingo!
Nobody accepts my skills. I learned how to sell my products from a talented man, but unless my products  themselves are good, nobody would accept me. You're right, an artist who doesn't succeed isn't a real artist. But I decided on this path, so I need to keep trying.
Good luck!
Consider another job
Thank you! I will do my best. My motto is Art is the only path.
I plan on following my dreams to the bitter end. Thanks for the advice! I hope I can get people to understand my works and my heart.
*Sigh* Is my art really that bad?
Basic Conversation Merchant Hikaro
I heard you're going to Corpse Church for Ofilia. Well, this is just for good luck - do your best for Ofilia. Good luck!
I hate people who are not moderate
What do you think is the most important thing in life?
Hm, very good! Young one, I ask this to everybody I meet, but I've never had an answer  like yours. For me, the most important things are good wine, money, beautiful girls, and... true love. Perhaps you think I'm greedy but one who's lost everything would understand that the  world is simply based on those trends.<pf>When one hasn't a penny, nobody would come talk to him. On the other hand, any rich person would know the jealous stares that wealth brings  about. People truly are fickle. I drink good wine to forget about the fickleness of the world and use money solely to fulfill my goals.<pf>I'm sure I don't need to explain why I like beautiful women. Any man shouldn't hate beautiful women! I was like that too... I thought there was such thing as true love until I met her here.
I know
No I don't

Basic Conversation Gardener Nikita
The most important things for growing a beautiful bonsai are sunlight and water. Also, to make sure the roots don't get bitten by bugs. Of course, it's essential that you  tend to it often. Otherwise, even in a good environment, it won't grow well.
Basic Conversation Adventurer Karorian
Are you here on an adventure too? I hear there are rare minerals here. I just got here, so I don't know if that's true yet.

Experience x50
Thank you for going in my place! It was an excuse, that I didn't have time to go to her party. I had nothing to give her, so I put all my love into a picture. But I don't want anybody to know she's a friend with a failure like me. I might just be over thinking it, but I don't think Ofilia is one who judges things by their looks. Oh yes! please take this as a token of my appreciation.
Basic Conversation Little Girl Ulay
Thank you so much for helping me. One day, if I open a restaurant, I will invite you. Promise.
Did you find the real reason?
Yes
I can't tell you
Oh, I see. But I'm glad everything is going along well.<PF>But why did he tell you to defeat a <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Chimera</FONT> before defeating a  <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Stalking Rakshasa Court Lady</FONT> and <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Dying Witch</FONT>?<PF>I wonder if he had a secret motive...? I heard here that somebody from the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Nine Land Alliance</FONT> is forming a spiritual  organization in this world and running it secretly.<PF>Of course, I'm not sure if it has to do with the destruction of Wiyu's town or the sudden construction of a shrine on the Southeast Shore.
Please tell me! What do you know?<PF>You probably won't tell me because I always trouble you so much. I promise I won't anymore, so please tell me the truth.
Did you find the real reason?
So you've come. Perfect, I was just wondering what to do. Monsters are beginning to ravage the Southeastern Shore again. It seems to be something different from last time.<PF>I thought you'd help find the cause of the monster outrage there, but to think they've shown up again...
That's impossible
What can we do?
It's obviously not impossible, it's already happening.<PF>When I received my award, the Southeastern Forest suddenly started burning. It's all calmed down now, but the councilmen say it's too unnatural, that the fire must  have been started by a person.<PF>So I want you to go check! I'm worried.
I don't know what to do either. All I wanted to do was to help Wiyu.<PF>To think we'd hear about her hometown's troubles again. Help me think!
I want you to hear the news of when I got first place.
I finally found you. I have some good news. What do you think it is?
You got famous?
I don't know
Close! But not quite. I... I'm actually pregnant!!<PF>Of course, it's not your kid. It's my true love... So embarrassing! You can't tell anybody. You don't believe me, do you? Would I trick anybody about something like this? The perfect me?<PF>...<PF>......<PF>I lied.<PF>Just kidding! I tricked you! Just as you thought, I got famous. Look at my happy face! I got the first place!<PF>I got the honor in my grandfather's place. The competition Judges all said my knife skills were already legendary.<PF>So, can you tell Wiyu this? I still have to attend the ceremony and such, so I can't go back yet.
You're so boring. Way too serious.
Thank you for collecting all the ingredients. I'm confident I can win now.
Thank you so much for telling her. Maybe we just need to give her some time to think alone.<PF>Oh, by the way, the details on the competition just arrived. It will be split into three parts.<PF>The first part is Basic Cooking Knowledge, which I'll ace, since I learned so much  from my grandfather.<PF>The second part is Cooking Knife Skills, which is my forte, so I think I can pass this  one too. The third part just arrived now.<PF>The name is Godly Knife Skills. We can only use three ingredients in the tournaments, but we need to make 10 types of  food.<PF>This is to test our skill and knowledge. Of course, I have a plan. I want you to help me out a bit.<PF>These ingredients are incredibly hard to find. Please help?
Alright
Are you using me?
Thank goodness! I'm not going to lie, the things I need can only be found from monsters!<PF>These ingredients are spread all over the place, and there's no way I can get them all  myself. It's very dangerous too.<PF>If you don't want to get yourself in danger for me, or if you don't think I should be making others do this for me, you really don't have to.
Sure
I'll think about it
Great. The first ingredient I need is <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>25 Jellos</FONT>, which can be found from <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Viscous Slimes</FONT> who live in  <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Saint Field</FONT>.<PF>I'm still debating on the remaining two ingredients. We don't have time to waste, so please go get me <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Jello</FONT> while I think.
No problem. If you can't, I'll just change the ingredients.<PF>You don't need to throw your life away for me.
Don't say that! Of course I don't...<PF>Don't tell me you're not going to help a cute and weak girl like me?
I'm sorry. I was busy earlier. So, how is it? Have you learned anything?<PF>(Explained the situation.) <PF>Originally that shrine was built to give people faith after an invasion of monsters a few years back.<PF>Of course, that story can't be trusted. I also think that shrine is suspicious.<PF>The monsters that attacked Wiyu's village were influenced by the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Ruined Mansion</FONT> and  began attacking the nearby villages.<PF>Of course, this would shock Wiyu a lot. But I want her to know the reason her hometown was attacked.<PF>I think that only by standing up against her fears can she stand up against her brother's illness.
Sure
Do I have to tell her?
Thank you so much. She can't leave Meteor Pit because of her brother, so I have to leave this to you.
I think this train of events has caused Wiyu to shut everything out of her heart her whole life. I think it would be so great for her to be able to bravely face the world.
Oh yeah! You know I'm competing in the third cooking competition, right?<PF>Last year Wiyu only got second place, but this year I'll take her place and show that my grandfather's cooking skills were number one in the world.<PF>I have my family's legendary knife that you brought me too.<PF>I guess this might not nothing big for you, but claiming the first place for Wiyu is important., but I'll still do my best to get first place.
Why is it important?
Good luck
Basically, Wiyu and I both lost our parents when we were young, so my grandfather  raised both of us. We grew up helping each other out.<PF>That's basically it. You've already gotten our family knife to me, but I want you to do us one more favor.
Okay, sure
Again...?
Thank you. I don't know if you've heard from others, but Wiyu is from a little village in Southeast Thunder Hill by the ocean, a quiet place away from all the troubles of the world.<PF>However, 12 years ago, monsters attacked her village, and her parents let her and her 2 year old brother escape by boat, eventually saved by  my grandfather.<PF>I signed up for this tournament so that I could move forward in life, and because I felt I could find something for Wiyu.<PF>It hurts my heart so much having to watch her struggle. I was hoping you could go to the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Southeastern Beach</FONT>.<PF>The <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Little Shrine</FONT> that appeared after the monsters left is there.
Awww~ You're going to torture a weak little girl like me. Fine, I don't need your help! You're terrible~.
Don't worry, by my grandfather's name, I will get first place.
You are...?<PF>Oh, I remember, you're the one who... um... chased after me! I have a good memory, hahaha.
......
Okay, do you promise?
I'm kidding. I really don't remember you at all.<PF>Maybe... If you help me, I'll remember you. What do you think?
You just want my attention
Don't remember me
Okay! I want you to go to my amazing sister Wiyu's place, and take the legendary knife, <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>King's Triones Sword</font>!
Aww! You're so boring!
I'm sorry. I already like somebody.<PF>He is currently a lieutenant of a brigade of the Meteor Hill Remote Security Force. Isn't that cool!<PF>If you prove yourself better than him, I would consider you though~
I'm preparing for the third cooking contest. Every year the objective is different, and this year it's held in Thunder Hill.<PF>Last year the objective was Tastes that make people drool.<PF>Wiyu got second place, a record that doesn't shame my grandfather's name. This year the objective is Godly Knife Skills.<PF>I don't plan on losing against her. By my grandfather's name, I swear I'll show that my grandfather's skills were number one.
Basic Conversation Plague Dungeon Rescue Crew 7th Brigade Lieutenant Gerute
Thank you for helping me. If I ever need anything else, I'll ask you again!
Thank you. You are truly a great partner to the 7th Brigade.<PF>I pray that someday we could work together for a better tomorrow. Did that sound cool? Hahahaha...<PF>I was wondering if you could help us with one last thing on this level. It's an easy task. I want you to tell <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Johns</FONT> about our progress. It's very easy, but equally important.<PF>Our success here will help determine where he will be placed in the future.
Please, let me go
Sorith would be faster
Thank you so much for listening to all my please. I was planning on making Sorith go, but he injured his leg in the past battle.<PF>He can't move very quickly anymore. So I hope you understand.<PF>If Johns needs anything, please help him out. Thank you, I await your return.
I know you're a hard worker, but I think your bag is full... Come back after you've cleaned it out a bit! I can't give you anything like this.
I think so too. However, Sorith just injured his leg, and can't move too much.<PF>We can only do basic treatment. I don't know who else I could ask. If you change your mind, I would be forever grateful.
Let's celebrate while we're still alive! Our next battle is extremely difficult. We are slowly approaching the core of this case.<PF>That's right! It's <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Evil Spirit Scare Crow</FONT>.<PF>He's the powerful general form of Sir Vampire King. He is also our biggest obstacle. Long ago, our general fought Sir Vampire King.<PF>We thought we could defeat him, but he forcefully hid himself.<PF><FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Evil Spirit Scare Crow</FONT> came out of Sir Vampire King's body at a crucial moment, causing our general's brigade to be destroyed and defeated by Sir Vampire King.
Okay
I can't take them all at once
I'm glad you understand. We really wanted our general to defeat Sir Vampire King.<PF>However, he is no longer suited for the front lines. We plan to have him plan out our strategy though.<PF>In fact, the reason we were able to make it this far is because we were able to meet up with the generals.<PF>Thanks to that, we were able to learn about our enemy before starting. Anyway, that is our plea.
That's nice of you
I don't need that
Hahaha, just don't tell the general. And make sure he doesn't find out.<PF>Or else we'll get in trouble. The general's only priority is safety.<PF>If we change his strategy on my whim, he'll yell at me.<PF>Well, it's up to you now! Please, help us take this last step!
Of course, people won't accept this type of idea. I've never told anybody an idea like this one. You're the first! I myself understand this will bring a huge change to our mission. However, I want to do this. Don't tell anybody about this! I won't forgive you if you do.
There's a reason to this. I'll tell you sometime when you're free!
You rested up? Alright, here's the objective for the second level.<PF>Earlier we simply came down the first half of the hallway.<PF>This time we need to do one more thing to counter the Evil Spirit Scare Crow.<PF>That's to make sure that we don't get attacked from behind while we face the Evil Spirit Scare Crow.<PF>Same as before, I'll take the right side - I leave the left to you. We need to clean out the latter half of the hall now.<PF>Clean this area out of <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Skeleton Fighters</FONT> while I take out the Cursed Mummies. Once we're done, we'll meet back up here, got it?<PF>The enemies this time are even more powerful. We need to be even more careful this time. If we die, it's over. You ready?
Ready
Huh?
Alright, that's good. Let's go complete our missions!<PF>Once we're done, don't forget to meet back up here. And don't go too far alone.<PF>You targets are <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Skeleton Fighters</FONT>.
...I also forgot what I just said! Let me think for a second. Come back later.
I have faith that you'll help us in this attack! Alright, we really need your help, even if you don't want to.<PF>Hahaha, I'm kidding... *cough cough*...*cough*.<PF>Let me tell you about our plan! Thanks to Sorith's scouting, we were able to find the Corpse Church B2 routes, as well as the locations of monsters. Corpse Church B2 is primarily split into the left and right.<PF>Sorith has already begun attacking the left wing. Our current mission is to clean out the route while minimizing our losses. Leave the right wing to me.<PF>I'm leaving the left wing to you and Sorith. Got it?
It's too hard
Can I forfeit?
Of course, we can't do it at once. You're such a cute little guy.<PF>Hahaha, even I wouldn't be able to do it. This mission will be broken into several stages. Your first objective would be to clean out the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Living Dead</FONT>.<PF>I'll take care of Fossil Gargoyles. Once we finish that, we'll meet back up here and think up a strategy for the second level of our mission. Alright, good luck!
You're scared? If you're scared, leave now! We don't need cowards here!<PF>If you say you're not a coward, come back to me later!
Sorith just reported to me that the majority of the monsters here at Corpse Church are undead and have no soul.<PF>They're all transformed <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Sir Vampire Kings</FONT>. Because of that, they all have indestructible bodies. If we don't use silver weapons to destroy them, we won't be able to harm these monsters at all.<PF>Otherwise, we will not be able to vanquish the monsters.
How?
Should we retreat?
I've been discussing with Sorith, and we were wondering if you could go back to Meteor Pit and bring back somebody  named <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Tima</FONT>.<PF>He used to be in the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Meteor Pit Security Force</FONT> and designed various weapons tailored to different monster weaknesses.<PF>However, he got sick of the life of killing, and quit the security force so he could pursue the researches he liked. He still helps us out a lot though.<PF>I'm sure he would help us on this too. So if you can, I was hoping you could go ask him to help us out.
Leave it to me!
Way too much work!
Thank you. However, you need to keep in mind that <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Tima</FONT> doesn't want many people to know about his past.<PF>Basically, he just wants to live a quiet and peaceful life.
You... You've been influenced by the monsters! Stay strong!<PF>You mustn't be influenced by them. Wake up!
No. We cannot turn back now. If we retreat now, we will lose.<PF>Then we would end up needing much more power to fight back. We need to end this now, in this mission.
Heh... I appreciate your cooperation. It's all thanks to you that we're still alive.<PF>You've saved my life. We're stuck on B1 and B2 of Corpse Church already. Do you think you could help us again?
It can't be helped
I'm tired
Excellent! Haha, well then, bring this note to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>John</FONT> who's in <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Plague Dungeon</FONT>. He is the leader of our brigade.<PF>Tell him that Sorith and I are okay, and his face is also fine. Don't worry. We will complete the mission soon.
Thank you for your cooperation. But you're already carrying too much. Your bag is already full. Clean it out, and come back to me.
I see. Well then, you take a break for now. If you can still help us later, come back to me.<PF>Either way, I'm stuck here for a while, hahaha.
......<PF>...m....<PF>.........mm......<PF>...uh...You...j...just...now....<PF>......damn...monster.<PF>My body won't move at all! Ugh!
What happened?
Take a break
Earlier, after you left, I... *coughcough*... was attacked by a monster who's whole body was  wrapped in lava, and was defeated in one hit.<PF>He was incredibly powerful. We don't stand a chance unless we attack first. I can't fight anymore. I have a favor to ask of you.
Leave it to me
I cherish my life...
You'll do it? I'm so glad - how could I ever thank you?<PF>If I'm not mistaken, the monster that attacked me earlier was a <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Magma Gargoyle</FONT>. I don't know his exact location because I lost consciousness. Be careful, he is very strong.
That's true. It's good that you value your own life.
Okay, I'll rest for a while.
Do you mind if I ask another favor?
Sure
Farewell
Earlier, when you were collecting metals for me, I heard one of my people scream. However, I'm in no condition to help him. I'm sorry, but could you go look into it?
Okay
I need to restock
Th...thank you...m... *cough*. The person's name is <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Sorith</FONT>.<PF>He should be in <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>B2</FONT> of this building. Be careful when you look for him.<PF>If he was attacked by monsters, please, help him out. I'm very worried about him - please, hurry.
Okay, I will wait for you here. Please hurry back!
M...*cough cough*... Go, hurry!
Thank you for helping me. I thought I was done for...<PF>Fortunately, God seems to still be on my side. However, I won't be able to move for a while. Just standing is tough enough.<PF>I have something to ask of you though. Do you mind?
Not at all!
Sorry. I can't help.
*cough cough*, thank you.<PF>I was searching for <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Destruction Metal</FONT> that <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Destroyer Frankensteins</FONT> carry, by order of Tima from Meteor Pit. Tima says that this metal can increase the hardness of our weapons.<PF>I don't know if it actually works, but can you go collect <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>10 Metals of Destruction</FONT>?
*coughcoughcough*.. *coughcough*... Okay! I shouldn't force you to do anything. I'll think of another way to do it... *cough cough*
Ng... Damnit.... I can't stand. Can you lend me a hand?
Sure
I don't have time for that
Well then, can you go defeat some nearby <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Magical Knight Dullahans</FONT>? Thank... *cough cough*.. You.. *cough cough*
You heartless man... *cough cough*
Are you an adventurer? The monsters here are incredibly strong.<PF>If you are incapable, get out of here now. I can't guarantee your life.
Basic Conversation Plague Dungeon Rescue Crew 7th Brigade Johns
Thank you so much for helping us for so long. Plague Dungeon is already under our control.<PF>Of course, we still have the problems of monsters and Black Wind Grandmas, but I have faith that my brigade can complete our mission here.
Thank you. I pray that you continue to work hard for the world with your kind heart.<PF>Thanks to your help, our mission is coming along well. We are approaching our last mission. Could you give this news to our general?<PF>I have a few things to tend to first, and cannot leave here. please, go for me.
Easy
No
When you come back, I will be sure to thank you plenty. Well then, give this announcement to general Kamyu.<PF>I need to stay here and take care of a few things.
Oh my, you're carrying too much. Clean out your bag and come back.
You don't want to? I understand. It's a shame, since I had such a wonderful prize for you.<PF>If you change your mind, come back please.
Thank you for helping us so much. Leave the rest here to us.<PF>However, since we have our hands a bit tied up here, can you go see <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Gerute</FONT> and see how he's doing?
Men, we have finally made it here. There's no turning back now.<PF>Gerute and his men are also doing their best over there. Meteor Pit's future lies in our hands. It is our responsibility to fight for the world we live in.<PF>It doesn't matter what happens to us after this fight. It doesn't matter how much we suffer in this fight! We need to remember all the friends we have lost, and make sure their deaths were not in vain. Our goal is To conquer Black Wind for the people. These monsters have already influenced our daily lives. Let us fight to the last man for the future of our world. It is all up to us now.<PF>Are you all ready!?
Of course
Wait wait!
Finally, let's make it back alive.<PF>That's all.
Once you're ready, come to me!
Let's do our best! We're almost done. All that is left is this last mission. Our current target is Cat-Eyed Ahrimans.<PF>If we too had their abilities, we wouldn't have had to lose so many friends here... Anyway, let's get ready to go. Once you're ready, come to me!
Ready
Just a bit longer
Well, here we go!<PF>Good luck!<PF>One warning though. When fighting a Cat-Eyed Ahriman, if a Black Wind Grandma does anything, you cannot fight them up front. If you can, run.<PF>Don't forget this!
Once you're ready, come to me!
This is finally the very end. Let me explain our attack route.<PF>The moment we go into <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>B4</FONT>, we will be attacked by Cursed Knight Dullahans. We must first defeat this obstacle before dealing a definitive blow to their lines.<PF>Next would be the eye of Black Wind Grandmas, <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Cat-Eyed Ahrimans.</FONT> Cat-Eyed Ahrimans have the power to see everywhere in the Plague Dungeon. Thus, it is essential that we defeat all the Cat-Eyed Ahrimans in the cave.<PF>If we can defeat the Cat-Eyed Ahrimans we can prevent them from seeing our every move. Also, Cat-Eyed Ahrimans only appear <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>near Black Wind Grandmas.</FONT><PF>We had initially thought Black Wind Grandmas controlled Plague Dungeon,  but we were wrong. They are only the source of magic power to the monsters in Plague Dungeon.<PF>The one really controlling all the monsters is <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Fairier!</FONT> By defeating Fairier, all the monsters in Plague Dungeon will no longer know what to do. At that point, we would be even be able to defeat all the monsters in the area.<PF>That's the gist of the situation - got it?
No way I am doing this!
I'm getting a headache
That's fine. Anyway, all you need to know Is that our current goal is to defeat  <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Cursed Knight Dullahans</FONT>.<PF>Don't worry about anything else, alright? Once you're ready, come to me. Failure is not an option in this operation.
Ready
Just a bit longer
Here we go! Don't forget, upon completing our objective, come back.<PF>Don't get bloodthirsty and go ahead without us. That would be like committing suicide.<PF>Good luck!
Okay. Take a break first.<PF>It's important to maintain energy. If we don't fight at full strength, we could be defeated by the monsters. Once you're ready, come to me!
It seems like we've been pushing you too hard. Don't worry, go take a break. It's important to maintain energy. If we don't fight at full strength, we could be defeated by the monsters. Once you feel ready, come to me.
Thank you. You rebuilt our supply line. Thanks to you we can engage in long battles with the monsters.<PF>With the supplies we have now, we can reformulate a strategy. Can you take these supplies to Gerute, who's at Corpse Church? I'm sure they also need these supplies.
Okay
I have a stomach ache
Thank you. We'll spend this time formulating a good strategy. Take these to Gerute.
This won't do.<PF>You already have too many items. You can't carry the supplies like this. Organize you're bag and come back!
That's not good. Fity might have some medicine for that. Or rest up for a while.
This is bad. Earlier somebody from the Security Force's Medical staff came to confirm that we had  received our supplies.<PF>However, they already left a week ago. So it should have already arrived. Maybe the staff that carried the supplies was attacked by monsters. They... probably already have.
Guess I'll have to.
That's unfortunate
However, we're in a crucial moment here. If we lose you, we don't know if we can hold off the monsters.<PF>This is a dilemma... Let me... think a little bit longer.
Leave it to me
Take your time
Alright! please, go for us. We will hold off until you come back.<PF>Go to the entrance to Meteor Pit, the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>border between Meteor Pit and Spiritual Land</FONT>.<PF>There you can meet <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Doctor Fiya</FONT>. She follows all supply and rescue missions. After confirming, come back to us! I don't know how long we can hold the monsters off...
Mm, come back to me after a bit. I need to think this through rationally.
Yes, due to our weakness, we've caused the deaths of so many of our friends. This crime is all my fault.<PF>Initially I thought I could save many people. To think that it would end up sacrificing the lives of even more people...!
I was waiting for you. The enemy in this mission is powerful. Are you ready?
Ready
Just a bit longer
Good luck. Our objective is the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Martial Arts Sickle Weasel</FONT> in <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>B3</FONT>. Be careful.
Once you're ready, come to me!
I'm glad you hadn't left yet. Earlier, Fity and I were researching the Plague Dungeon. We're currently in B1.<PF>Marcy is doing her best in B2. Currently, B3 and B4 are our goals. However, it is impossible to get down to B4 right away.<PF>My strategy is to slowly travel down the cave. Obviously, our strength has its limits.<PF>On top of that, we also need time to resupply. In B3, there are <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Spirits</FONT> and <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Martial Arts Sickle Weasels</FONT> that are causing us problems.<PF>Several squads got to B3 but were unable to get any farther. Spirits cause confusion in us, even causing us to kill each other. Even if we resist those skills, we get attacked by Martial Arts Sickle Weasels.<PF>My thought is to first get rid of all the Demonic Ghosts first, then push through  the Martial Arts Sickle Weasels. You may be thinking it more important to stop Black Wind Grandmas who  are the source of the spiritual energies of the monster, but we would need many warriors like you to stand a chance against the Black Wind Grandmas.
Okay
I don't know
As long as you understand. Alright, go get ready.<PF>We have a tough battle ahead of us. Once you're ready, come tell me.
Okay
Wait a sec
<FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Demonic Ghosts</FONT> are somewhere in <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>B3 of Plague Dungeon</FONT>. Please do it as fast as possible.<PF>We're pressed on time. Good luck!
Once you're ready, come to me. These things can't be rushed.
That's fine. It'll be easier to understand this by experiencing it first hand than thinking about it. I think you'll get it once you go fight.
I truly appreciate all of you help. With you, we were able to quickly conquer B1 and B2.<PF>We've completed our first level mission now. We need to report our status to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>General Kamyu</FONT>.<PF>However, we can't all leave to report our status. If the monsters launch a counter attack, all our efforts could be undone. I want you to go run the report to Kamyu.<PF>This mission isn't very hard, but we have no time. Could you do this for us?
Roger
Too easy
I hope you will one day join our squad. One of the criteria for a person who can be great is to be able to quickly make good  decisions.<PF>You can already quickly make your judgments. To be able to correctly Judge Punishment of things, you need lots of experience. I can't make you decide right now.<PF>I would love to be able to teach a young one like you.<PF>This is the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Report</FONT> that I want you to carry. I want you to take this report to somebody named <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Kamyu</FONT>. He is the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Grand Commander</FONT>. he should be in <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Meteor Pit</FONT> right now.
Please organize you bag.
True, it's just carrying one document. However, this task requires speed and accuracy.<PF>Any sort of information can greatly affect our conditions. You must not underestimate the importance of this task. Once you understand that, come back here again!
You have already passed my test. Your abilities are undoubtable.<PF>We, the Plague Dungeon Rescue Crew are having trouble moving past B1 and B2. The reason is that <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Soul Knight Dullahans</FONT> are preventing us from going farther in B2. Other squads have also taken great damage from Soul Knight Dullahans, and many of our allies have been sacrificed.<PF>General Kamyu decided to hire me here to execute the mission. We are succeeding in holding off the monsters, but cannot move forward at all. However, fortunately, we have found light in these dark times.<PF>You have the power to help us push through the obstacles ahead of us. I'm sure you understand the difficulty of this mission. Will you help us?
Sure!
That's...
Alright, let me explain this mission to you. Earlier I explained that the obstacle in B2 is the Soul Knight Dullahan.<PF>They use power magic and regenerate themselves many times. However, the moment he is defeated, the other monsters on B2 are significantly weakened.<PF>We will take that chance to wipe out all the monsters and continue to B3, getting closer to our final target, the Black Wind Grandma.<PF>I'm sure you can understand now. please think it over again. This could be life threatening, so I want you to think it over.
Leave it to me!
Let me get ready
In your eyes I see strong faith and courage. I'm leaving mission <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Defeat the Soul Knight Dullahan</FONT> to you.<PF>If only more young ones were like you, we would not have to fear these monsters at all.
Once you're ready, come to me.
You're hesitating, aren't you? Don't worry, I don't blame you.<PF>This is a difficult mission. It requires a very strong will. Once you are sure you can take this mission, come back to me. We'll be here for a while.
Thank you for contacting our other members. You are very gifted.<PF>Would you be interested in working for me?<PF>I need somebody young and gifted like you. In the future, I will recommend you to the Meteor Pit Security. please consider it!
Give me the briefing
Let me consider
I can't give you too many details now. I must first confirm your skills.<PF>Otherwise, I would not know what type of missions I could assign to you. It would be unfair to you if I assigned you missions without knowing how skilled you are.<PF>Do you understand?
Okay
Don't look down on me
First, go to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Plague Dungeon B2</FONT>, and defeat <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>20 Dranzos</FONT> and come back to me.
If you think so, then you think too differently from us. I cannot ask you to take on our mission.<PF>The most important aspect of working as a team is to believe each other.<PF>Without this trust, no matter how strong we are, we will easily be defeated by monsters. Come back to me after thinking it through again.
This is a very dangerous mission, so I won't force you to. If you ever feel like joining us, we'll take you any time.
Good job. By the way, do you want to try another mission?
Okay
I want to go back
You're really courageous! Do you want to join the Meteor Pit Security?<PF>If you want, I can talk to the General for you. Hahaha.<PF>Anyway, let me brief you on this mission. I think I told you before, but besides Fity and Marcy, who is in B2, we have <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Lieutenant General Gerute</FONT> and <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Vanguard Sorith</FONT>.<PF>I sent the Lieutenant General and Vanguard to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Corpse Church</FONT> to survey the area.<PF>I haven't heard back from them since. Can you go relay my commands to them?
That's fine. I'm not the type of person to force others to do difficult tasks.<PF>If you really want to go home, go. However, if you change your mind, please tell me.
Get out of here! The monsters here are too strong.<PF>We have already lost so many friends. We don't want to lose anybody else.<PF>If you have nothing important to do here, leave now! From the way you look, did you come here on an adventure? Looking for treasure?<PF>Or...
None of those
I'm lost
Then what did you come to do? It looks like you're a pretty confident person.<PF>If you're really that confident, do you want to try a mission? Think about it.
Take the mission
Deny
Good! I like kids who are brave and energetic. The future needs people like you.<PF>Our rescue crew has 4 more members: <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Lieutenant General Gerute, Vanguard Sorith, Backbone Marcy, Doctor Fity</FONT>.<PF>Fity is this lady here. Earlier, I had <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Marcy</FONT> go ahead to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Plague Dungeon B2</FONT> to search the area.<PF>However, he still has not come back. I'm worried about him.<PF>I must wait here for the other members, so I can't go check on him. Fity is helping injured members and thus also cannot leave.<PF>You mission is to go find <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Marcy</FONT>.
If you value your life, you should get out of here.
Lost? You're currently in Plague Dungeon B1.<PF>The monsters here are significantly stronger than those above. If you aren't confident in your strength, it's best you run away.<PF>If you run into a Black Wind Grandma on your way, run as fast as you can.<PF>The monsters here are incredibly violent because of the magic from the Black Wind Grandma.
Get out of here! The monsters here are too strong.<PF>We have already lost so many friends. We don't want to lose anybody else.
Basic Conversation Backbone Marcy
As long as I am alive, I won't let these monsters have their way!
Basic Conversation Doctor Fity
This is our last battle. Thanks for being used by... oh... I mean being useful to our General.<PF>Once I'm done with this fight, I want to go home and take a nice bath.<PF>Oh yeah, take these supplies. The general told me to boost your morale.<PF>Don't push yourself too far. There is a limit to an individual's strength, but with five people, they can be very strong. In other words, only together can we conquer this problem.<PF>I pray that you finish your missions smoothly.
Please clean your bag. As it is, I can't help you at all.
The <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Cat-Eyed Ahriman</FONT> isn't a particularly strong monster. However, you need to be wary of the many spells they use.<PF>Oh, that's right! I was about to forget to give this to you. This is from the general. He really cares about you.
Please clean your bag. As it is, I can't help you at all.
Our mission this time is to defeat the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Cursed Knight Dullahan</FONT>. Our Backbone Marcy fought him before.<PF>Back then, Marcy was only a intern member, but out of the interns, he was by far the best.<PF>Regardless, when he faced the Cursed Knight Dullahan, he didn't stand a chance.<PF>Even now, if Marcy had to face him, he would probably have a hard time. That's how strong Cursed Knight Dullahan is. Be careful.<PF>Also, Cursed Knight Dullahan carries a huge sword and wears a full body golden armor. He's completely different from the standard monsters you usually face. Our general gave you these supplies. Use them well!
Please clean your bag. As it is, I can't help you at all.
Good job. I'm glad I'm not a fighting member of the crew. Otherwise all the jobs you're doing now would have been mine!<PF>Anyway, this job is going to be tough. <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Martial Arts Sickle Weasels</FONT> and <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Thunder Sickle Weasels</FONT> form packs. You need to be especially careful.<PF>This is the last supply pack I kept hidden. If the next set of supplies don't come soon, we won't be able to hold off much longer...
Please clean your bag. As it is, I can't help you at all.
My my. That sounds like our general. He forced this mission onto you, didn't he!<PF>But it's true - we need your help. Hey, I'll give you something nice. Don't tell the general.
Please clean your bag. As it is, I can't help you at all.
It looks like you're beginning to understand the troubles we've been facing. Down in B2, we're about to reach our limits because of the Soul Knight Dullahan.<PF>If possible, I'd like you to help us out. I was told by General Jons to help you out.<PF>Don't worry, I'll do my best to help you. Once you're ready, let's take on this challenging mission!
Please clean your bag. As it is, I can't help you at all.
So you're going to take Johns' test. There's not much I can help you with, but take this.<PF>And don't tell Johns. I'm not supposed to help you out.
Please clean your bag. As it is, I can't help you at all.
The monsters here are strong, and if you get injured, it would be dangerous. If you don't need to be here, you should leave now.
Basic Conversation Vanguard Sorith
What a pain! I guess I'll get it done fast so I can come back sooner.<PF>I wish I could be back home right now, relaxing and drinking tea~! Alright, time to get this done with.
Basic Conversation Meteor Pit security team Grand Commander Kamyu
All thanks to you, the mission in the Ice Cave is finally complete. Thank you. The next time we recruit members for Meteor Pit Security Team, please remember to apply again!
I hope the teams stationed around the world can complete their missions.
Monsters are running amok these years, and people can't find their living. The Meteor Pit security team only have limited members. They want to recruit more people, but there are very little people who are truly dependable. With such a future and in such circumstances, what could I do? You have any idea? Young man?
So what do we do?
I have no idea.
Although the Four Societies appeared to be in peace, they are actually tight in tension. The superiors scheming against each other, the boycotting between the cultures and the conflicts between the sects within the cultures are just some of the troubles. There are times when humans are not even as united as the monsters. When will the selfish humans realize this? Sigh~
How can I help?
There's nothing I can do!
It might be better not to get involved in the political conflicts. Getting involved when you are still young cannot be a good thing. Our team is currently in need of people. To solve the crisis in the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Black Wind Cave in the North East</FONT>, we've used up a lot of labor. We're in need of warriors. We're training new people, and they are not ready to be sent to the field. And our next recruitment is half a year away, if you are willing to help me, that'd be great.
I will help!
I regret my decision!
I wonder if you have heard from <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Timas</FONT> about our missions. At the moment we have teams stationed in the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Black Wind Cave</FONT> and the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Corpse Churce</FONT>. And in the distant <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Western Continent</FONT>, there is a city established by <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Saint Cylon</FONT> - <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Saint Joel</FONT>. His team included people from the church and the scientists. During <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Saint Cylon's</FONT> stay in Saint Joel, he discovered the rich energy resources and so he set up the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Holy Core Knight</FONT>. To utilize and develop the resources, he set up the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Soul Lab</FONT>. Since the resources around <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Saint Joel</FONT> is too rich, it attracted people's greed. They fell under greed's control again and again. The resources in the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Ice Cave in the North East of Saint Joel</FONT> is one of their aims. Although we have sent one of our teams to the place, I don't think they alone could handle it.<P>I have sent for reinforcement to the Core Knights repeatedly and recieved no reply from them. Since you are willing to help, please head to the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Ice Cave</FONT> and look for a <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Combat Squad Captain Trott</FONT>. Please go assist him! If Johns can wrap up his mission fast, I have planned to send his team to the Ice Cave as support.
I knew you'd say that, after all, humans are afraid to get in trouble, I'll find a way myself!
You could be right, you're young, get out of the war zone! This isn't something you could change, Sigh...
Ignorance is bliss, being an everyday guy could be a fortunate thing. Looking for normalcy is beyond my reach now.
Monsters are running amok these years, and people can't find their living. The Meteor Pit security team only have so much members. They want to recruit more people, but there are very little people who are truly dependable. With such a future and in such circumstances, what could I do? You have any idea? Young man?
Basic Conversation Meteor Pit Security Force Overall Lieutenant General Yuty
I'd love for you to join our forces.<PF>Eh? Oh, you're not joining.<PF>Judging from your aura, I thought you were our savior, a hero for our future. The security force would be a great choice for you. It's our responsibility to rid the world of evils and allow the good people to relax.<PF>It's out goal to do as many good deeds as possible. For example, we must help an old person cross the street at least once a week. If it's on a holiday, we must do it multiple times.
Basic Conversation Meteor Pit Security Force Doctor Fiya
The human body is like the microcosm. Everything is available, and anything lacking is taken in from outside.<PF>In order to fix a disease or injury, you don't need a special skill or method. You just need to relax and rest every day. You heal by taking in proper nutrition in a relaxing atmosphere.
Basic Conversation Hermit Sinsha
...?<PF>Who are you? What am I doing here? Can you tell me who I am?
Wh...what?! What did you say?<PF>You defeated a <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Dying Witch</FONT>?<PF>It would seem God has finally listened to my long time prayer. I am thankful that he brought a warrior like you.
The monsters in the Ruined Mansion are gradually becoming stronger. Young one, if you want to defend the world, this is a path you will eventually need  to take.<PF>Not sure? The magic of the Thunder Shrine will keep you safe. Are you ready?
Yes
No
Well, the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Dying Witch</FONT> is in the deepest area of the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Ruined Mansion</FONT>. On the way, there may be monster attacks. If you keep a strong will though, you will be able to defeat any obstacle.
I see. I guess I was wrong. To think you were the same as the average person.<PF>It's not a mistake to try to save yourself when faced with a dangerous situation.<PF>However...*cough*... Your choice will bring danger to the people for sure!! please reconsider!
Did you also come here to pray?<PF>There is an endless supply of mystical powers here. Pray from the bottom of you heart. It will come true for sure.
Basic Conversation Helper of the West Iche
Thank you. I pray that my friends who were taken over by evil will be healed.
Thank you so much for the other day. We were able to advance our research thanks to you.<PF>The other day, there was an important breakthrough, and I have to go gather materials again. Could you help me out with that?
Let's hear about this
No
Thank you. I couldn't tell my leader that I didn't collect the materials last time.<PF>Next time! Next time I will tell him the truth, that this brave young one helped me out. This time, the material I need is the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Wounded Eye</FONT> from the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Tragic Witch</FONT>.
Uh....! You really are quite funny. Ha...ha...haha...
Thank you. I pray that my friends who were taken over by evil will be healed.
What should I do? What should I do?<PF>Many of the people in the Nine Allied Lands have been affected by the monsters and are being  monstrified.<PF>One by one they are becoming monsters. So... Yes. Do you think you could help us?
Sure
Another day
Because of the monstrifications, our leader told me to collect the belongings of the monstrified  people. I am hoping that through analysis and research, we can find a cure, but we need to have a <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Roaring Flame Wings</FONT> from the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Crimson Harpy</FONT>.
Okay! I will ask somebody else then.
Are you a tourist? This area used to be a peaceful little fishing town.<PF>However, it was destroyed overnight. We don't know if anybody survived that night. It was quite a tragedy.
Basic Conversation Helper of the West Rubion
Thank you. I hope to advance our research and find a way to use the magical powers from these.
Thank you for helping me the other day. I'm sure you know what I'm going to ask you now!<PF>Exactly! I need to find more materials for research. This time, I need something even more powerful.<PF>So it might be a bit tough. You'll need to head to the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Ruined Mansion</FONT>. This mission is dangerous, you'll need to find the power to suppress the enemy. Will you help me out again?
Alright
I'm busy
Thank you so much for doing so much for me. I have nothing to give you except for the mission briefing.<PF>What we need this time is a <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>SecretStone Fragment</FONT> from a <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Living Statue</FONT>,  which has mysterious powers. This objective requires more attention than the last one.
Okay. Well then, I won't make you. If you get the time, please help me though.
Thank you. I hope to advance our research and find a way to use the magical powers from these.
Hello. I am <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Helper Rubion</FONT> from the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Nine Allied Lands</FONT>.<PF>What am I doing here? Why thank you for asking!<PF>I am collecting the items that the monsters in this area drop. All items that monsters carry, as well as equipment contain energy. This energy is different from human energy. If we analyze and research this energy, we should be able to harvest and use this energy.
Anything I can do?
Good luck
You really are kind. Well, now that you mention it, I've just bumped into a problem here, so I'll ask you.<PF>I'm currently stuck here because I encountered a problem. I need a <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Tiger Claw</FONT> from a <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>High Chimera</FONT>. I can only do so much alone, and thus can't get it. So please, help me out.
Thanks for worrying
Monsters are known to have lots of mystical powers. If we could analyze those powers, perhaps we could use them against the monsters.

How in the world should I write this report?
You... you seem to have experience big battles for some reason.
I just saved the world
I just dropped a bridge
Saved the world? What in the world did you do?<PF>Did you go to that <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Ruined Mansion</FONT>?
Oh, so you heard!
Hehe, not going to tell you
What did you do there? I sincerely hope it's not what I'm thinking!<PF>If so, it'd be bad news.
I defeated the dying witch
Just visited
Oh no! That's bad...<PF><FONT COLOR=#00ff00>The Ruined Mansion</FONT> was originally part of the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Nine Allied Lands</FONT>, and one day,  somebody from the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Ogre Ghost Society</FONT> came and turned everybody in the Ruined Mansion into monsters.<PF>Their goal was to take over the entire area near the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Thunder Shrine</FONT> and enter <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Thunder Hill</FONT>.<PF>The <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Dying Witch</FONT>, despite her current looks, is actually <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>the old leader of the Eastern tribe</FONT>. The Ogre Ghost Society passed false information about the Ruined Mansion to the world, claiming it to be the location of monsters.<PF>And as a result, the old leader of the Eastern tribe has now, at your hands...<PF>I must go talk to our leader Towy and report the situation. Hopefully we can find a means to solve this problem...
You really like to joke around don't you? Just visited there? Do you know how dangerous it is?
Avoid the Ruined Mansion if possible. The Ruined Mansion is a very important place for the Nine Land Alliance.<PF>It's is one of our key locations. On the surface, it looks like monsters are roaming the area, but there is actually a good reason for their presence.
Take care! To be able to drop that big bridge...<PF>That's pretty impressive, hahaha.
The monster craze here is out of the ordinary. We need to investigate.
Basic Conversation Council Head Guard Sunson
Thank you for your help, everyone in the Secret Religion is grateful to you.
Thank you for being such a great help. I thank you on the Prophet Council's behalf. We used to be strangers, but you've been such a great help, lastly, I hope I could give you this last mission, please tell the Prophet Council that we have completed our mission, are you willing to take this last mission? I need to investigate the Inferno Castle and it's developments thoroughly, so I can't head back yet, thank you.
Leave it to me!
I'm so tired!
Thank you. Please take this <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Note</FONT> to our <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Prophet Leader Ryugen</FONT>, I will reward you when you're back.
Although you've been a great help, your bag is full. I can't give you more missions at this stage.
What a shame! I was going to award you with a big prize if you helped out one last time! But if you're unwilling to help, there's nothing I can do.
Now we only need to deal with the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Keep</FONT>. Our mission is coming to an end, but still, we can't afford to be complacent, since there are just too many of them. I still don't know how much resources the organization behind these events have. We can only try to solve all our problems. We still can't see them, this is too disadvantageous to us.
What organization?
How dreadful!
We have no idea about the organization behind these events. I have heard of rumors, but those are not confirmed. Just treat them as gossip.   You should know about <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>The Thunder Shrine</FONT>. It's rumored to be built by the organization. Yet it is in ruins. It looks as if it was destroyed by the monsters, but there is a questionable point: the only monsters that wreak havoc are those in the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Ruined Mason</FONT>. This is strange. It's a shrine built to suppress monsters, but the monsters living in the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Thunder Grassland</FONT> didn't get involved in the destruction at all. That's why I find things dubious. Besides these, whenever the Four Societies discuss about the direction to take in the future, there will be people jumping out to object to the suggestions that are obviously made to improve the well being of the humans. I won't tell you who those people are! Since I'm not allowed to second guess our Superiors, I'm just doing my job. No need to oppose my superiors. Ouch! I've told you too much. Just treat that as a piece of gossip. Don't take it to heart... !!   (Bang! Crash! Bang! Crash! Crash~~)   It's finally here. This is the last trip. Are you ready?
I'm ready!
Not ready yet!
The same procedure, please go to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Winless</FONT> and get the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Jar of Purification</FONT>. I wish your success. I'm indebted to you and your help. Please come back alive, so I can reward you.
No problem, come look for me when you are prepared!
Sigh. There's nothing we could do about it. Since the target of the Four Societies is just that obvious. Solving our current problems is the only thing we can do.
Now we only need to deal with the Keep. Our mission is coming to an end, but still, we can't afford to be complacent, since there are just too many of them. I still don't know how much resources the organization behind these events have. We can only try to solve all our problems. We still can't see them. This is too disadvantageous to us.
Now the aura in the Inferno Castle F1 is stabilized. It no longer smells of evil. And all thanks to you. Now we only need to complete the missions on the F2 and in the Keep. We still need you help in the future.
Let's go suppress them!
Find me when you need me!
That's a good question. We have no idea how to determine which type of monsters have absorbed the aura of the sealed monster, or maybe the monsters themselves contain the evil power. If we have to eliminate all the monsters in the Castle, that's be too inefficient, and we'd split our teams into too many bits. Now we wait for the minute the aura escapled, and then we go eliminate the monster that smells the most strongly of this aura, this is how we achieve our target. (Bang! Bang! Crash Crash! Crash Crash! Crash Crash Crash~~)  Here, here's our chance, Winkless should have finished with their preparations. It's what we've estimated. The aura leaks out from <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>the direction of Inferno Castle F2</FONT>, Set off immediately when you're ready! Are you ready?
All ready!
Wait a while for me!
The aura is quite powerful, and it's clearly distributed in <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>The rooms in the four corners of Inferno Castle F2</FONT>. We'll repeat the process. Please go to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Winkless</FONT> and get the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Jar of Purification</FONT>. Thank you.
Sure, please come to me when you are ready.
No problem. Since the aura is still stable, you can relax for now.
Now the aura in the Inferno Castle is stabilized. It no longer smells of evil. And all thanks to you. Now we only need to complete the missions on the F2 and in the Keep. We still need you help in the future.
Now the preparations for the repairing of the seal is completed. We just need to wait now. The organization that hides behind these events will not be happy to see the seals getting repaired, so we just have to wait here and be ready for the monsters to pounce back.
Action?
Pounce back!
It is a natural reponse to struggle when we are bounded by a rope. The monsters will respond  the same way too. Plus they are more frantic. There will be a stronger response from them  as time passes. Therefore, <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Yulian and Yuhe </FONT>are trying to produce the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Jar of Purification</FONT> to prevent the evil forces from breaking out! <PF>(Honlonlon! Honlonlon! Honlonlon! Honlonlon! Honlonlon!!)    The <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Jar of Purification</FONT> will not produced whenever you want. It takes some time to produce. After all, the production requires powerful spiritual armament. <PF>Please get <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Jar of Purification</font> from<FONT COLOR=#00ff00> Yulian</FONT>... By the way, I haven't even asked you if you will help me out. I have to protect <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Yuanlian</FONT>, so I cannot leave. Will you please help?
Sure!
I will protect the sisters!
Please please go to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Winless</FONT> and retrieve all the remaining <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Jar of Purification</FONT>. Come back immediately when you have used up the Jars. By the time you come back, we'd have created the next batch. If you don't have the Jars with you, no matter how many monsters you slay, you still won't complete the mission. Please remember this. The monsters we know of are those in Inferno Castle F1 <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Heavenly Unicorn Spirit, Eerie Crow, Bamboo Umbrella</FONT>. I hope you can deal with them.
This... IS my most important mission... Don't mistake my meaning. I mean their lives are important. If I don't ensure their living chances, I'd never repair the seal. Please don't mistake my meaning.
Yes, this is like tying you up with a rope. The normal reaction is to struggle. To try to get out of the rope, the monsters do the same thing, and they lose their mind even easier than humans. We'd soon face even stronger struggles, so Winkless and Ulaless are trying their best to create Jars of Purification to deal with the aura that might explode later... !
If we can't find a way soon, we'd be swallowed by the demonic aura. I think I'm falling deeper and deeper under its influence. I no longer retain my calm and I get mad easily. Please, hurry and find the way to repair the seal.
Seems like you, too, could feel the power of the aura. This frequency and the power of the aura overwhelm all of us here. We're out of resources while we're just dealing with the escaping aura. What other methods and resources could we use to find out about the cause, not to mention ferret out the organization working behind them...
Organization?
Go work hard!
Ah! There I've said it, but it's no secret any way. Actually the note you sent me when you first came contains one more mission for me to carry out. From the reports, our council already confirmed that there is an underground organization acting in the dark. Their actions just haven't emerged into the light. The elders in the council were afraid to alarm them and treated this matter as a first class confidential matter. They hoped we could deal with it on our own and without others noticing. So I don't only have to repair the seal, but I have to ferret out the organization behind the damages...
Me instead of 10 others?
Please take care of yourself!
Yeah, so how about it? You want to come into the Prophet's council to help out? Well, it's just that not everyone can become one of us. You need to be part of the High Mage Society, and you need to go through all sorts of training and tests to get a chance to get in. But then only when you're part of the Prophet's Council that you get the knowledge, so a lot of people are accepted in to the council when they were born. Yet, for every year, we reserve a limited amount of positions for people with special circumstances...   Wait! This is the escaping aura, and it's the first time I felt such a chaotic aura since I came... !    (Crash! Crash! Bang! Bang! Crash Crash Crash Crash Crash Crash~~)   It's surprisingly strong this time. Are you willing to help me? If you don't you might see my corpse lying somewhere beside the road! Hahaha...
Um, let's go!
Ouch! My arm is hurting!
Before you set off, go to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Winless</FONT> and get the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Jar of Purification</FONT>! We might need a lot. Please confirm before you leave, and with the leaking demonic aura, we have to fight from region to region.
Stop kidding around. You really are not helping me? And I thought we were friends. It seems like people's observation skills are getting worse and worse.
I will take care of myself. Have you seen two sisters by my side? With them here, I eat well and sleep well everyday. Don't worry about me!
Is that it?! I thought you'd be more concerned. How disappointing!
Lately the demonic aura are dispersing oddly, and they are getting stronger and stronger. If we can't find the reason soon, we'd be in grave danger.
You still want to hear the stories about the secret religion? Hahaha, it's not anything to brag about, but I'm proud to be a part of the secret religion and the prophet council.
Do you have more stories?
What a braggart?
You really want to listen to stories. Very well, I will tell you another one. Do you know why there is a huge statue of a knight in the Inferno castle.? In truth the knight itself is the massive seal. The Wicked King of the legends is sealed there. But as time flies by, the statue is weathered, and demonic aura came out of it. The aura attracts the weaker monsters who came to it for protection.<PF>When the monsters increase in number, the aura gets stronger, and the monsters that lived under the aura became more and more powerful. With this cycle going on and on, the monsters here are much stronger than demons in the other areas. But these are my gueses. Since the statue isn't this easy to break down, there must be something else, just that we didn't know what that is. Now that we've gone off topic again, Hahaha.
Is this the only story?
You want a drink of water?
How observant of you, to know what I want. Have you seen the pair of beautiful twins I have around? They are <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Winkless and Ulaless</FONT>.  They belong to the Heaven's Union. We Prophet Council and the Heaven's Union have formed an <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Imperial Guard</FONT>. Standing united, we carry out missions around the world. <PF>Since the Prophet Council is not as sensitive to the Nature as the Heaven's Union, and the Union didn't have the powers to quash monsters, we compensate each other's weaknesses. But then there are a lot of conflicts between these two... Groups... !! <PF>(Crash! Crash! Chase!)  There it goes again, this time the demonic aura comes out from <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>two places in F1</FONT>, the escaping becomes more and more frequent, we need your help again, are you willing to take the mission? It's alright if you're not willing.
I'll do it quick.
Then I'll wait for you here.
Please, remember to look for <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Winkless</FONT> and get the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Jar of Purification</FONT>, without it, going is fruitless.
Then I thank you!
Drink your water. Having said so much, I'm thirsty, hahaha.
Shall I call it bragging? I'm just proud to be part of the secret religion! Hahaha.
Lately the aura is escaping at an alarming rate and also getting more frequent. If we don't find the cause soon, we'd be in danger.
The seal in the Inferno Castle is getting weaker everyday. If we don't find the cause soon, I'm afraid the legendary monster will break out of the seal in the next few months. When it comes to that, we'd be too late...
Monster of the legends!
I have to be the savior?
Um, there was a powerful demon living in the Inferno Castle a few centuries ago. Nobody knew his true form or why he existed or existed for whom. He is wrapped in mystery. The only thing we know is of his overwhelming power and the fact that he laughs crazily when he murders humans. The laugh doesn't go through your ears. It goes straight to your head. If you're not determined enough, you'd lose our mind.<PF>The starter of our religion led a team of determined warriors to battle the monsters. At the end of the seven days, we finally sealed the monster here. Later we named the battle as the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>War of the Seven Days</font>. Our great leader records the process in the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Book of Castle Hira</font>, and the people who can access the book are limited to the few important members.<PF>Oh right, I forgot to ask you! What brings you all the way out here?
Ryugen asked me to!
To listen to your stories!
So that's it. Let me see the Note!   (After half a minute...)  (Crash ! Crash! Crash!) What is this strange earthquake? Seems like the monsters are getting restless. The aura seemed to have come from <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>F1</FONT>. May I ask you to head over there and investigate?
Sure!
It's too dangerous, no!
How wonderful! I knew it was worth telling you so many stories... Ah! no, I meant it's worth trusting you. You are a dependable person. The demonic aura came from <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Inferno Castle F1</FONT>, you might have to find the exact location on your way before you go, please ask <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Winkless</FONT> for a certain object. We need it to control the escaping aura.
And I once thought that you were a dependable person!
Story! This is not a story. This is the pride of our secret religion. The pride of the Prophet Council. If you want to hear about the past, wait until I come back from my mission at the Thunder Hill. I will tell you the things we were praised for. For now, please leave this dangerous place.
Hahaha, by you? Hahahahaha, the youngsters nowadays are truly blindly confident!
It's not the same as the past. Inferno Castle is filled with monsters. Although everyone says that it's because the seals are weakening, I don't think it's this simple. There are too much questionable points.<PF>First, why are the seals around the world weakening? And all of them happened in the recent years. Second, all the locations of these seals contain the power of the seals, which are the fruits of ancient wisom. No matter how weak they became I believe they still have some power. However, the monsters in these areas have become stronger and stronger.<PF>Third, I've heard that there was an organization looking for minerals with powers. Nobody knows the structure of the organization and its members, but it must be a powerful organization. Fourth, there are the Four Societies in the world. Tthey all know that the monsters are wreaking serious havoc, but they didn't stand up to them as a united front. They even try to get into each others way. This made me think if there is a power behind the Cultures, controlling their moves. <PF>In the ancient times, the Four Societies can cooperate and grow together. Why can't the Four Societies now do the same thing?  These are all questionable points, but the most important thing is that the weakening of the seal in the Inferno Castle is an odd thing. We have to investigate.
Basic conversation Council Guard Sintha
The seals around the world is getting weaker, but the monsters are getting stronge. I worry what the world would become in the future.
Basic conversation Council Guard Kabel
Hateful monsters, creating havoc everywhere. They dare to think they could do whatever they like. I'm not afraid of them.
Basic conversation Northern Head Server Yunin
I wonder if I may be of help? This is ruled by the Heaven's Union and the Prophet' Council. Only when everybody's united could we stand against the overwhelming force of the monsters. We hope that peace would come in the near future.
Basic Conversation Northen Server Winkless
Hehe, you're here on an adventure? Be careful, it's dangerous here.  I am very capable although my little sister always said that I was clumsy... Eh! Sunson has also said that I'm clumsy癒HThe head server and the leader have also said that... Ehhh? Why did it seem like a lot of people found me clumsy. I am very capable~
Basic conversation Northen Server Ulaless
Thanks for all you've done for us. When we get back to Thunder Hill, if we'd meet again, let us reward you. Let us, a pair of beautiful twins, thank you properly.
Thanks to your help. The demonic aura in the Inferno Castle are under control. Although some of the aura have dispersed to other areas, they should not be too much of a threat.
Demonic Aura's still there?
Thanks for your hard work.
It doesn't matter. Leave the leaked demonic aura to us. We have a more important mission for you. We hope you could return this <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Book of Castle Hira</FONT> to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Northern Northern Head Server Yunin</FONT>, and please tell her that the mission was completed successfully. I wonder if you'd do it?
No problem!
I'm tired!
Please let <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Head Server Yunin</FONT> deliver a message to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Northern Chief Badi</FONT>. That the leaking aura from the Inferno Castle is mixed with something mysterious and demonic. This aura is obviously different from the powerful aura within the seal. The aura of the monster in the seal was threatening and powerful, yet this aura is murky and evil. Let the tribe knows that they have to be careful. Thank you.
Don't make things more difficult for me. Please go clear your back pack first. It's overflowing.
You're finally tired! I thought you were made of steel. You've done so much for us but never complained that you're tired.
How could we complain of fatigue when it's you who've helped us so much? When I first met you, I thought you were frail, but now I find you dependable.
We hope you'd give us your assistance in the missions in the future.
Thank you for obtaining the sealed stone! Did the leader say anything else?
He hoped you were safe!
No, he didn't say anything.
Relax, we all value our lives. When something goes wrong, we'd be the first to run. No, wait, we'd be the first to look for reinforcement. Let's return to the topic. When you were with the Heaven's Union, we have obtained knowledge on the locations of the pillars from <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Sintha and Kabel</FONT>. There are four of them at every floor, and the weakest two pillars are in <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>F2 and F3</FONT>. We hope you could go to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>the damaged pillars</FONT>. Are you willing to take the mission? Or do you want to rest?
Okay, let me do it!
I will rest a while!
Then, according to our investigations, the room at the four corners at every floor has a Sealed Stone Pillar. In <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Inferno Castle F2</FONT>, the weakest pillar is in the room at the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>South East</FONT>. In <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>the Keep</FONT>, the weakest pillar is in the room at the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>North West</FONT>, I hope you could repair the stone during this trip. The way to change the stones is recorded in the book. It's quite simple, really. Just take down the damaged one and put in the new one. How unexpected, then we will trust you with the seal. Right, when you're on your way, you should be able to meet the soldiers stationed in F2 and in the Keep. They are <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Sintha and Kabel</FONT>. They are currently there as spies, please give them a sealed stone in case something goes bad.
Don't make things more difficult for me. Please go clear your back pack first. It's overflowing.
Then you go for a rest first. Come again when you are ready!
No... No!! Our leader is coldblooded. I'm afraid of him.
You came right in time. I just flipped through the Book of Castle Hira. The monster in the castle wasn't sealed by the secret religion alone. We Natural tribe made important contributions. However, it's weird how our ancestors said that it's the secret religion that placed the seal, but it's the Healer Society that maintains it. This is the part I don't get.
How do we seal a monster?
Congratulations!
We've found information on this. According to the book, Inferno Castle is made up of a large number of rooms. People in the past found the spots with the weakest aura in soe of these rooms and placed <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Sealed Stone Pillars</FONT> on them. Every pillar has a gem with the power to seal monsters. So the power of the seal depends on these gems. These are called the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Sealed Stones</FONT>. <PF>I guess some of the stones are weakening, that's why the demonic aura in the Inferno castle is out of control.
Then what should I do?
So that's it.
At the moment we have no idea how to obtain the sealed stone. Please return to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Thunder Hill</FONT> to look for our <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Northern Leader Badi</FONT>. With this knowledge, perhaps we can create the Sealed Stone. When you are on your way, we will do our best to locate the pillars of the seal. I'll leave the mission in your hands.
As for the exact location of the seal, the book didn't mention clearly. The Book of Castle Hira has a few pages torn. Perhaps those are written on the torn pages. Now we need closer investigation to know the exact location. How troubling.
I hope I could find a more detailed message.
We can't stay like this. To fight the dispersing demonic aura, we've already used up all our resources. I don't think we could last another month. When the time comes, we have no choice but to retreat. If we have the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Book of Castle Hira</FONT>, perhaps we could find a way to solve the problem.
Book of Castle Hira?
Ugh! I feel dizzy!
The <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Book of Castle Hira</FONT> is written by the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Starter of the secret religion</FONT>. It contains information on how to seal the monster in the Inferno Castle. It also has information on the monsters like their strengths, weakness and habits. At the moment it's taken care of by the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Prophet Council</FONT> and the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Heaven's Union</FONT>. <PF>If only we could have the Book of Castle Hira... But we no longer have the resources to head there. To maintain the power of the seal, my sister <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Winkless</FONT> and I have to stay here...
Then can I be of help?
I can give you a massage!
You want to help us? Nothing would be better. Book of Castle Hira is currently in the hands of <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Northern Head Server Yunin</FONT>. She is currently on <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Thunder Hill</FONT>. Please retrieve the book as soon as possible, or you won't see us when you came back.
Don't try to lie to me. You're just here to take advantage of me.
Dizzy, I'm sorry we don't have medicine for that. You can hurry back to the village to find a doctor.
Don't come here if you don't have to. Those not powerful enough will be corrupted by the demonic aura. Even if they didn't lose themselves completely, they would have lost their minds. So... Do you think you can stand to stay a while? Don't make me send someone to take you back to the village. That'd be embarrassing.
Basic conversation Prophet Leader Ryugen
Thank you for your help. Everyone in the secret religion will be grateful.
Seems like you have found Sunson. He's quite somebody, right? Our Council Mayor Sunson is a veteran warrior. If you think you are capable enough, assist Sunson. All of us in the Secret Religion will be grateful to you.
Um...
You're frowning so deeply...
Then I won't bother you.
Sigh... There is something you don't know. You should have heard of the Inferno Castle! There used to be a powerful and violent monster residing in there. The starter of our secret religion has led a team of warriors to fight the monster, and the battle lasted seven days before he sealed the monster in the Inferno Castle. Thing have been uneventful until now. <PF>During the recent years, we noticed the demonic aura at the castle getting stronger and stronger, and this aura has been spawning monsters over there.
You know the reason?
I have nothing to do with it!
The reason why! You know, the monsters are getting stronger and stronger in the recent years. There aren't many places where humans could live in peace anymore. Our Council has a theory. We think there is a rather powerful underground organization. Although we know nothing about their purpose or their structure, we know they are up to something. They are trying to return the power to the monsters and remove the seal.<PF>The <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Inferno Castle</FONT> might be a spot related to them, but we have no proof. So our council's <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Crimson Prophet</FONT> sent our strongest <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Council Mayor Sunson</FONT> to the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Inferno Castle</FONT> to investigate. However we have lost traces of him. We are worrying about what to do if the seal has already broken and we worry that we have lost a capable person. Can you help us?
How should I be of help?
It's too dangerous, no!
You are willing to help me. This is wonderful. Then please head to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Inferno Castle</FONT> to look for <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Sunson,</FONT> the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Council Mayor</FONT>, and pass him the Crimson Prophet's <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Ching Shing Aing Note</FONT>. The contents are important. I hope you could locate him successfully. I thank you in advance.
Although the Note is light, you still need to have some space to carry it. Your back pack is full. Please come back to me after you have cleared it.
Knowing how to love yourself is the start to knowing how to care for others. You know the limitations of your powers. It's a type of wisdom as well. I will not blame you.
You're right, it has nothing to do with you. It's just that your home could be destroyed by monsters, and your food could be plundered. Perhaps you don't feel the pain, but they are destroying our world and our way of life. Sigh.
It doesn't matter. This is something our council has to take care of. I can't trouble you with this.
Young hero, this is the judiciary of the High Mage Society's Prophet Council. Although it's a judiciary, we're simply protecting Thunder Hill. Lately, the monsters have caused a number of havocs. Relying on the Imperial Guards formed by the Prophet Council and the Heaven's Union is not enough, as our forces are too scattered.<PF>Human's needs, greed and conflicts caused by ambition resulted in our inability to form a united front against our foes. Our fighting inside our ranks have already used up our energy. This sort of future is indeed a source of anxiety.
Basic conversation Combat Squad Captain Trott
This place is guarded by the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Ice Cave Combat Squad</FONT> formed by the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Meteor Pit Security Team</FONT>, it's dangerous, leave, quick.
I wonder if there's improvement in my communication skills.
You've improved.
Still space to improve.
Thank you, but if I have to open my mouth first, I'd...
Take your time!
Don't give up!
I'm just a man of few words. It must have been hard for Taylay to stay by me. She must have found my silence boring. The <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Scared Dew</FONT> you gave me is about to be ready. It has absorbed enough power from the Ice Cave. It's been sparkling from a while ago. It's time to ask you to take it to the Devil Ice Mirror. I don't think the mirror's power could last for long. Are you willing to take another trip?
Of course.
Umm, I'm tired.
Then please take the Scared Dew to the Devil Ice Mirror!   I forgot to remind you of one thin. When I was stationed at the Ice Cave, I've seen a professional soldier enter the cave. I've forgotten his name, but I chatted with him for a bit and knew of a secret. He said that a rich businessmen in Saint Joel sent him to the Ice Cave, but he never came back after he entered. I believe he could take care of himself, though. The most important thing he said is that a rich businessman sent a large batch of professional soldiers and hunters to eliminate monsters. He seems to be trying to safeguard the land, but the professional soldier I chatted to said things weren't as simple as that.<PF>That's why he went to the Ice Cave, to investigate the thing that attracts the hordes of monsters and why the seal was weakening, and what was attracting the professional soldiers. He said that all of these are related to the Demonic Religion he has been investigating. I've only heard of this organization from him. Right now, nobody know of its scale, location, members or powers. We just know that they are involved in a lot of things that happened to this world.<PF>Before you enter the Ice Cave, please beware, when you passed the Scared Dew to the Devil Ice Mirror, your mission will be completed. I'll leave this in your hands. Please be careful though. You are one of the few people I could talk to freely. If you were injured, I'd feel guilty!
Then you go clear you back pack!
You're already tired of me, Sigh~
Um, I will try my best to start talking.
I know, because if someone doesn't speak first, I don't usually speak.
<font COLOR=#00ff00>Scared Dew</FONT> needs some time to absorb enough powers Wait a while more!
Let me talk about the other members! <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Minyu</FONT> is a very childlike kid. He likes to runaway instead of facing his troubles. He's quite afraid of <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Robell's</FONT> radical ways. That's why I sent him to follow Robell into the Ice Cave to train his courage. Speed is Minyu's main advantage so I sent him as a vanguard. He's wimpy, afraid of death and blood. If he can't become the vanguard, he couldn't be anything. He certainly can't be in charge of core tasks or medic tasks.
Anything else?
Why did they send you?
<font COLOR=#00ff00>Ages</FONT> envy <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Marcy's</FONT> capabilities. Although Ages is not a very good student, isn't all that powerful, and doesn't even have the smarts, he has the determination. What he's good at isn't the sword or the strategy. It's his active vision and his reflexes. Since he isn't all that gifted, we hoped he could solve his problems through hardwork. This personality resulted in his getting scarred all over.
Is there anything else?
Then what about you?
<font COLOR=#00ff00>Taylay</FONT> and <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Fity</FONT> are of the same year. They came to the training center together and grew up together. Taylay is Fity's best friend. Although they were sent to different teams, their friendship never dies. But I've heard that they have gotten into a huge fight once and it was resolved skillfully by the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Medical Captain Fiya</FONT>. After that incident, they became even closer friends. Fity is a nosy girl while Taylay is a quiet, sweet girl. The Medical Captain Fiya likes Taylay, so she took the pair of girls with her wherever she goes. This is why other doctors thought the pair of girls have priviledges. In reality, Fiya demanded more of them than she does from other doctors. Although Taylay is sent to us, she has to complete a mission set by Fiya, so that should be an extra test!
Is there a new mission?
You just won't talk right!
You just said that you can't pass the Fire Stones to the Devil Ice Mirror teams because they too were influenced. So I found another way. I just thought that we could head to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Saint Joel</FONT> to look for the senior <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Runo</FONT>. I've heard that he's knowledgeable and might know the way to repair the seal on the Devil Ice Mirror.
Maybe! Especially to people whom I've just met. I am a man of few words. Is that called dull?
Me? I don't like conflicts or fights. I like living the quiet and uneventful life. If there are no missions, I'd find a place to read quietly, have a cup of tea and spend my days relaxing. Communicating with people is tiring, I don't know what the others thought and don't know what to say to them. I guess this is my shortcoming!
At first there are 20 teams in the Meteor Pit Combat Squad. Besides the Meteor Pit, there are 13 teams in charge with other combat missions around the world. The squad members are all chosen from the 20 Security Teams. This is to promote exchange between the members. Like this Ice Cave Combat Squad, we have members from the 11th, 12th and 14th teams. Before I head off to the Ice Cave, I've heard that 7 teams were sent to combat the foes in the Black Wind Cave, but at the end, only <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Johns</FONT>'s team is standing up to them. The rest either died in battle or are seriously injured. I truly admore Johns. As a late comer, he took up the post as Division Commander and carried out combat missions around the world. And he succeeded in all of them. Besides him, another remarkable person in the Security Team is the Security Force Leader <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Anthon</FONT>. He is barely below the Grand Commander and so is his capabilities. Since he's stationed in the Meteor Pit to defend it, he's the only one not assigned with missions. At first one of the teams in charge of the Black Wind Cave would come after they finished their mission, but the team was eliminated and the monsters are gettng more and more active these days. Under such dire circumstances, my superiors sent me here. My team could be said to be formed in desperation.
The <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Fire Stone瞻繭</FONT> is very warm and it seems like the monsters are running away from it.
You can try to tell me more.
Then all is well~
Then...Let me see... Then I will tell you the organization of our religion. Maybe this bit of knowledge might help you in the future. Although I work in the Meteor Pit Security Team <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>as the Vice Captain of the 12th Team</FONT>, and now I am the Division Captain of the Combat Squad in the Ice Cave, my rank is actually very low.<PF>My superiors include the Captains of the 12 teams. Then there is the Combat Squad Grand Commander Kamyu. Although Grand Commander Kamyu has his influence in the Metero Pit, he hates getting into political conflicts and is unwilling to rise up the ranks. The Meteor Pit Combat Squad has 20 teams. Each has around 20 members. <PF>Above the Combat Squad is an even larger organization. That's the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Holy Core Knights</FONT>. I've heard that competition between the knights are real intense. They don't share the same goal like us. And then the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Holy Core Knights</FONT> and the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Prohpet Council</FONT> are in conflict because of the difference in their ideals. <PF>Their main goal is the same - they all try to eliminate the hazards caused by monsters, but because of their different approaches, they can't open themselves to cooperate with the other.
Continue continue~
Is this the real you?
Then I will tell you about my team members. I am Division Captain Trott. Actually this is my first time being sent to be a team's Combat Team Division Captain. I have always been Vice Captain.<PF><FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Vice Captain Robell</FONT> is full of ambition. To achieve his aim, he'd use any means. Some of them were too radical. That's why he stayed as a Vice Captain. And he has always been jealous of <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Johns</FONT> people valued by the Grand Commander. The Grand Commander knew the situation, but won't get involved in internal competitions, and hoped that I could influence Robell. He was sent here to assist me, but I have no idea how to influence him.<PF>We've talked for so long. I almost forgot to tell you your mission. Please look for the location of the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Devil Ice Mirror</FONT>, and while you're on your way, distribute the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Fire Stones</FONT> to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Robell, Minyu and Ages</FONT>. We've been camping here for a while, and still couldn't find the true location of the mirror, perhaps only very special people could find it. I'll leave it to you. The Devil Ice Mirror is the only way to solve the problems with the Ice Cave.
Okay, let me do it!
You go alone!
Then I will leave this to you. In the mean time, I will try my best to train my communication skills.
You go clear your back pack first!
This is impossible, I have to stay here to deal with some important business.
Me? Actually I seldom open my mouth to speak, but I'll talk when I have to. It's just that it's hard to do it on my own.
With the Fire Stone in my hands I'm warmed to the bottom of my heart.
Here's a mission... !
You always talk so little?
I can't stand you any more!
Actually... I'm not very good with words. Excuse me, you're not the first one to complain.
What's the next mission?
It's hard to talk like this!
I am in charge of the mission in the Ice Cave. This area is covered in snow all year round. The ice never melts. I've heard that this place used to be filled with flowers and had good weather, but ever since the Snow Demons took over the place, they cursed it with ice and the paradise was gone. <PF>Although we defeated the Snow Demon and sealed it inside <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Devil Ice Mirror</FONT> in the Eternal Ice Wall, we still can't return this place to its original state. This place still remains icy and cold. The Snow Demon is sealed but it hasn't given up yet. It tries to break out of the mirror by luring the minor ice monsters here.
You're a good story teller.
You are kidding me!
I thought you knew. That's why I didn't tell you. Fine, I will change for the better.  We were just talking about the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Devil Ice Mirror</FONT>. The monsters sealed in the cave attracts a great deal of ice type monsters into the cave because the seal is weakening. Even though we have weapons that could defeat the monsters, this type of monsters just can't be eliminated. <PF>We need to restrain the power that attracts the monsters. So please head to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Saint Joel</FONT> and look for <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>the Weaponist Kalgof</FONT>. Unlike Timas, he researches on weapons that are designed to subdue specific types of demons. I hope you'd bring back some good news. Because... <font COLOR=#00ff00>Kalgof</FONT> is not easy to deal with.
I'm very... Very sorry!
This... I'm sorry!
Ehh~i don't want to either!
You've become stronger. We can assign this mission to you! Will you take it? This is a powerful foe. He resides in <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>B3</FONT>, If this monster is gone, maybe we'd have an easier time...
This... Well ok!
Eh..... Nevermind!
You look like you're in a difficult position. You go complete this mission first. This time the target is the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Ruman the Snow Spirit with an Secret Intention</FONT>.
Sigh~
At the moment your are not in a high enough level to tackle the next monster. Please stay here and wait for orders!
Not too long ago <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Ages</FONT> reported to me that in the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Ice Cave B3</FONT>, the monsters are being restless again. I hope you'd go spy on the situation? Will you take the order? Or do you find me too annoying?
It's... Ok!
Just a bit!
You're such a weird guy! This time the monster we target is the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Ruman the Natural Spirit of the Snow</FONT>. Please be careful.
I'm sorry, but this is how my personality goes.
We don't have missions for you at the moment. Please wait for orders here!
I just checked all the new weapons. They are usable. So here is another mission. Will you take it? If you dislike me, you can give up!
I'll just complete my mission
I can't stand you any more!
Hm, quite a young man. Please distribute these three sets of weapons to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Robell</FONT>, <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Minyu</FONT> and <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Ages</FONT>!
You go clear your back pack first!
Then there's no other way! (Am I that annoying?)
We couldn't let this continue. The regular weapons are too easily broken. We need new equipment, so I have a new task for you. Will you take it?
Sure.
I hate working with you.
Meteor Pit Combat Squad have requested Timas to develop a new weapon. I wonder how far he gets. Please confirm the situation with <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Patrol Vice Head Captain Yuty</FONT>!
Am I that annoying! ?
Just then there was an odd earth quake. It should have been caused by monsters plundering the energy minerals! I have a task for you now. Will you take it?
Sure.
You're very cold.
Then please head to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Ice Cave B1</FONT> and defeat the plundering monsters!
Really? Good luck to you.
We don't have missions for you at the moment. Please wait for orders here!
We need helping hands and it's dangerous. Are you still willing to assist me?
Yes!
No!
I have <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>3 Strategy Notice</FONT> here. I hope you can deliver them to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Robell</FONT>, <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Minyu</FONT> and <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Ages</FONT>. Thanks.
You go clear some space from your back pack!
Then what are you here for?
This place is patrolled by the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Ice Cave Combat Squad</FONT> which is formed by the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Meteor Pit Security Team</FONT>. It's dangerous here, leave.

Weep weep weep Don't hit me! Monsters, don't come near me! Weep weep, I'm so scared! If not for the Vice Captain, I'd steal back to the village. It's full of terror here. I just saw a half transparent girl. Weep weep weep. How can this be!

Ho! Hey you, is there something you need from me. If not, don't badger me during my mission! Ho! Right! You must have met a gallant gentleman on your way! Hoho! He is our Combat Team Division Captain! Although he doesn't talk much! Hohoho! But he's very calm and very kind. Halmose's the type that wraps his kind heart under steel! Ho!
Basic Conversation Combat Squad Doctor Taylay
Thank's for your hardwork these days. Thanks to your help. We managed to finish our missions successfully. We are very grateful.
The mission is reaching an end. This is the last pack of resources we have for you. We hope you could repair the seal successfully and complete the mission that we couldn't. Thank you.
Go clear some space from your back pack, or else our Combat Team Division Captain can't help you even if he wants to, hehehe.
Thank you for your hard work. You've been running around these days. These are things my Combat Team Division Captain asked me to prepare Although they are not worth much, please take them! I feel indebted to you for making you go on missions but not doing anything myself. After all, you are not part of our Security Force.
Go clear some space from your back pack, or else our Combat Team Division Captain can't help you even if he wants to, hehehe.
This time, the monsters are far more powerful than the regular ones. Please be careful. If you can't hold yourself against them, then don't push it. We avoid direct confrontations with that monster, because he's just too powerful. Although these won't be a great help, please take them. This is all we could do for you.
Go clear some space from your back pack, or else our Combat Team Division Captain can't help you even if he wants to, hehehe.
The monsters in the cave have started wreaking havoc. These are things my Combat Team Division Captain asked me to give you. Please take them and work hard.
Go clear some space from your back pack, or else our Combat Team Division Captain can't help you even if he wants to, hehehe.
Just... Just then, there was an intense quake in the Ice Cave. Seems like the monsters in it are getting restless. The siege has gone on for a while. I hope we can get rid of the monsters soon. I wonder what's going on on my best friend Fity's side.
You said you've solved their problems in the Black Wind Cave? You... You... You are such a strong ally. Seems like we have to leave the problems in the Ice Cave in your hands as well! Otherwise you'd only help Fity, and that's too unfair. Hehe. But Fity is far luckier than I am. She works beside a capable Combat Team Division Captain, unlike our Division Captain and our Vice Captain. <PF>One of them doesn't fight with others. The other's over ambitious; One of them is slow moving. The other is a hot head, sigh sigh. Right! Right! Just then our Combat Team Division Captain asked me to give you these. We hope they would be of help during your misisons. Please take them! Actually, the Combat Team Division Captain is just bad with words. He's a very kind man.
Go clear some space from your back pack, or else our Combat Team Division Captain can't help you even if he wants to, hehehe.
<font COLOR=#00ff00>Fity</FONT> is currently in <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Black Wind Cave</FONT>. She's under the lead of <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Johns</FONT>, a Combat Team Division Captain. Johns is quite a character. Even Grand Commander <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Kamyu</FONT> held him in high regards. Johns always does his all to climb the ranks and seems to have some kind of objective, but nobody knows what that is. <PF>We just know that Johns is a hard worker, and the Grand Commander Kamyu does all he can to pull him up. When ever our Vice Commander <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Robell</FONT> sees it, <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Robell</FONT> just couldn't help but feel jealous.
The Ice Cave used to be a beautiful place. But now it's filled with monsters. I don't know when it'd return to it's original state.

Get out of my way! Kid! This is not a place you can wander into! Get out of here and out of my way! But if you'd pay me <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>a high price</FONT> to help you research on <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>something</FONT>, I'd be very happy! If you want to set a minimum price, I don't think you can pay me less than <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>1 million gold coins</FONT>!
Basic conversation Senior Runo
Cough cough, kid, what are you here for? If there is something I can help with, just ask.Don't hold back. If there isn't, let me tell you a story. Perhaps you've heard of it before, but let me tell you again ! <PF>Long long time ago, the leader of the true religion Saint Cylon took a team of people from Saint Bay to Saint Joel to fight the vampire clan. The team includes priests and scientists. And during Saint Cylon's stay here, he found that the energy resources in the region are extraordinarily rich. He surmised that it was the reason that made the vampire clan so formidable. He didn't know where the vampires hide or when they'll appear to attack humans again! <PF>In the North Eastern area, there are quite a number of mines that contain large numbers of Crystal Quartz Stone with mysterious powers. However there are also large snow demons seeking to control them. To defend against the vampire clan, Saint Cylon established the Holy Core Knights. To utilize energy and develop technology, he established the Soul Lab. But because the resources are too rich, greedy people seek to lay their claims on them. <PF>At the end, they create conflict between the institutions and holes for dark forces to enter the Core Knights and the Soul Lab. And so the Four Societies could not cooperate. I've heard that the southern parts of the continent are invaded by monsters, and is becoming a sealed hell hole. All roads to the south are cut off. Nobody could find a way to reach there. Maybe one day we'd go! cough cough cough. I've been spewing nonsense, hohoho!
Basic conversation Senior Moreno
What is it? From the looks of you, if you're not part of the professional soldiers or hunters running around to battle monsters, you're part of the adventurers who run around collecting treasures. Seeing how you appear in Saint Joel, I think I know why you're here. 1. You're hired by the rich businessman to conduct the monster hunt;  2. You're here to join the Holy Core Knights;  3. Someone asked you to come to here, which is both full of resources and monsters;  4. You're just an adventurer who wants to travel around the world.  As to why you're here, I think there are a few reasons: 1. Someone told you how knowledgeable my brother and I are, and there are things you want to know;  2. The Holy Core Knights told you to ask me about strategies, since I've been a great help to them; 3. You want us to become your masters. We have so many new studentsevery year!;  4. Your curiosity is aroused when you saw us. Now, meeting you here means that you are quite powerful, because passing through the Spectre Station requires quite a bit of courage and power. Knowing people like us exist mean that you are a careful person. You pay attention to the discussions around you, since a lot of secrets could be gleaned from villagers' chit chat. The above is what I know about you from the first glance. Now what did I get it right?   (Hm~the old man's full of rubbish!)

The hero over there, how are you. I am the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Northern Chief</FONT>, I lead the tribes that belong to the Natual Culture in the north. I used to be a Soul Taker. Besides managing the public infrastructures in the order and taking care of land development, I am also a diplomat. In the recent years, the monsters are creating havoc every where. Our construction and development project fell behind schedule because of them. Not only that, the origin of resources are damaged by them. <PF>The teams sent by our nine regions get set to the frontlines continually. W're under attack both from the inside and out!  The other tribe leaders mock us. I'm so tired I want to leave this troubling place.. Right, I still haven't asked about your purpose for coming here. Hahaha, I'm such a clumsy person. I didn't even ask you.

I'm a traveling treasure hunter. If you find something rare, please notify me.

You're quite a good guy, but this isn't enough. I look forward to seeing you grow into a real hero. Then there'd be value in challenging you. I look forward to your development.
We've got quite a challenge this time. Are you still going to take the mission?
Yes
No.
Our target this time is the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Shield Knight</FONT>. He's really powerful. If you can defeat him and come back alive, then you can call yourself a real warrior. If you are determined to become one, go defeat the Shield Knight and prove to me! Then you are good enough to be in my team. Hahaha, as for the secret behind the bounty hunt, you'd have to investigate it yourself. I'm only interested in fighting powerful warriors, not in scheming and such.
Tsk! You afraid? Come back to me when you're ready!
You wait here. Although I have the lists, I still can't collect all of them immediately. Wen we're done, they'll give us the next list, so wait a bit. Come back to me later.
The bounty list is here. Yyou still want to continue?
Yes
No.
You surprise me. Let me tell you what's on the list this time. We're targeting the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Snow Banshee</FONT>. We've met her on our way to Sait Joel. Although they are weak, they still injured me. If I leave them to you, you either get fatally injured or die! <PF>Yesterday when I was having vanilla ice cream, the owner of the stall said that there is a conspiracy behind the hunt. Well, that has nothing to do with me, but if you're curious I'll tell you. That businessman... Actually, I don't even know his real name, he told us when he hired us, but I've forgotten... Anyways, that's not important.<PF>He said that the businessman hopes to gain some rare object from the monsters through sending batches of hunters and professional soldiers on the hunt. He has sent people to spy on us. I've noticed this long ago. I just didn't think it matters. To avoid people from noticing his true aim, he used monster hunting as a cover up. Frst he let us eliminate the monsters, then he will send a team to scavenge the goods left behind. <PF>If the hunter got a rare treasure, he'll pay a huge price to buy it off the hunter. This you should already know.
Tsk! Not enough reward? Or is it not challenging enough? Come to me when you want to take it!

He's called <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Sky</FONT> or something. He looked quite good, quite strong. If there's a chance, I'd go challenge him. The owner of the shop said he's going to the Ice Cave. And the monster in his list is a level higher. This means that someone thought we're not as strong as he is. My blood boil when I thought of this. You hurry off and finish all the missions! I want to leave this peaceful city!

You wait here. Although I have the lists, I still can't collect all of them immediately. Wen we're done, they'll give us the next list, so wait a bit. Come back to me later.
The bounty list is here. Yyou still want to continue?
Yes
No.
Tsk tsk tsk, I just made a discovery. If you look at the monsters in the list closely, you'd see that the monsters are getting stronger as you move down the list, but still, they are weaklings. The monsters we get is the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Iron-Armed Werewolf</FONT>. Also, none of us hired by the rich guy knows what other people have on their list. As to why our boss need to get into such trouble, it's still a mystery.

No.
Are you in need of money? But the monsters in the list are all weaklings. It's impossible to ask for a lot of reward. If you want the money, you have to pick on the strong monsters. But can you do it? Haha... This time, our target is the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Hell's portrait</FONT>, go work hard!

You must have come here after the bounty!   I've been here for some time, at first I thought the monsters here will give me exhilaration during battles. But they were a disappointment, they were too weak. I took the bounty list, do you want it? I will pay you according to the listed price, do you want to take it?
Sure.
Bounty?
What a quick response. You don't even suspect things. Anyway, any opportunity to earn money is a good opportunity! Tsk! Then you go defeat those <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Magical Mandala</FONT> first! Come back to me when you're done.
Tsk tsk, so you don't know!! Last week, a rich business man hired professional soldiers and hunters from all over the world. He gave them a list of monsters and asked us to eliminate them. After we finish with our tasks we just go and collect the bounty from his staff. I was interested at first, but one look at me, the monsters ran. How boring. Now the lists are all distributed, so you can't join the hunt alone. If you're interested, I can pass you my list.
Kid, you know where to get vanilla ice cream?
Basic conversation Mine Stone Collector Ikov
Thank you, because you gave me a chance to approach the core members of the underground market. If there is any way I can return the favor, please don't hesitate to find me.
Thank you for your help. You must have found it strange that I am so taken with the underground market. Actually, I've been hiding the reason from you. When I was young, my family has an heirloom. Although it has no mysterious powers, it was still quite a rare treasure. At that time, someone said that he wants to trade it in the underground market and robbed us of it. Of course my father tried to fight them off. At the end, my whole family was killed. The object traded last time was indeed my family heirloom. It's returned to me. But when I went to the seller to confirm, he said that my heirloom has been through many hands. The first person who traded it became the top member. To find the person who murdered my whole family, I need to have rarer treasures, so are you still willing to help me?
Weep weep~ Poor you~
Sigh~with all due respect~
It happened so long ago, my feelings have calmed. However, the one who murdered my family is still not found. That's why I was so busy with the transactions in the market. Now I need the legendary <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Brilliant Light Crystal</FONT>. This is very hard to get. I've done my investigations. This is a crystal of the legends. If I have this, I could get nearer to my enemy. Please I will be grateful to you if you could help me.
Relax! I've let that go. It happened so long ago. Now I want to concentrate on how to approach my enemy.
Thank you. I knew I'd meet you around here. I am now a member of the organization. Now I need to work to rise up the ranks. I wonder if you are still willing to help me?
Stop fussing over it.
Let me rest a bit more!
Hahaha, I have been doing nothing but create trouble for you. Now another member put out an object. It's something I have been looking for for ages. I have been searching for the location of that object, and now, suddenly, someone in the grounds is going to trade it. But he specified that he wants the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Water Glistering Crystal</FONT>. I thought if I met you, you'd be able to gather them. Help me out this time if you're my friend, please.
I'm not a slave driver. Go and rest if you're tired!
You've helped me such a lot.
Just then I forgot to mention that you have to gather the specified objects to meet the basic conditions.
Member?
Basic conditions?
Yes, to join the Underground Market, you need to meet the membership terms. To become a member, you have to find the objects specified by the organization. Then you need a recommendation by an existing member. Now I only miss one specific item. That's the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Splendorous Light Stone</FONT>. With that, my collection would be complete, please help me.
Hm, I was fortunate enough to have a friend to take me here to see the undergound trades. Of course I'm not a member, so I don't have the basic membership. I could only watch the process of their transactions. But one look at the process, I'm hooked. I really really want ot become a member so I can see even more treasures.
I don't know your aim, and I don't know why you have to tail me. I don't even know if you're following someone else's orders, but seeing how you've helped me, I will tell you a secret!  Besides the Four Societies you see from the surface, there is an even more powerful organization holding their reins from behind. Although I'm not interested in these things, the organization controls an <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Underground Market</FONT>. To become their member as soon as possible, I'm continually looking for rare treasures, and continually trading. I could only get near to the core of the market through this and get my hands on rarer treasures. During the last transaction, I got news that there is a mysterious power in the Ice Cave. That's why I came here to look for rare minerals. And somehow, you started following me around, so I'll give in to you. Now, are you willing to help me?
We're already friends!
Underground Market?
I'm so happy you said that because the next object I need is even harder to find. I have the list of minerals that should be in the Ice Cave. Te minerals we just found are low level treasures. If you are to help me become a member, we need to find medium level treasures such as the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Brilliant Crystal</FONT> at least. So I will leave the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Brilliant Crystal</FONT> in your hands. I think you wouldn't refuse me.
Yes, the Underground Market used to be for people to trade their rare possessions with others. Who knew that the modest meetings at the beginning would become an occasion for people to flaunt their wealth. How ironic!
... ..................<PF>...........  Can you tell me why you're following me? What you're doing is simply too strange. What kind of person would be willing to be ordered around by me and still stick around?
I'm here to make friends.
I told you when we first met
You don't make friends like this! I'm in quite a difficult situation when you act like this, although you've helped me find quite a few minerals. If you're here to make friends with me, I have one condition. You could find me the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Gleaming Ice Demon Stone</FONT>, then I will tell you a secret.
Sorry, I'm not interested in that. You've helped me with so many things. I truly thank you. You're such a good person.
You're annoying ! Annoying! Stop following me around!
I'm a kind person!
Am I that annoying?
Ah! Ah! Ah! Go find me the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Ice Demon Stone</FONT>, and get lost from my sight. You better get lost, because the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Ice Demon Stone</FONT> is rumored to have mysterious powers. Regular people lose their minds under its influence. They all eventually meet their doom. I hope you'd disappear like this!
You're really annoying! You just don't back off!
Fine, I will admit, for a small bit, that you are capable, but I still find you annoying. Why are you following me around? I don't have anything for you!
When I saw you, I thought...
I will prove my capabilities.
This... Please don't let me be mistaken. I'll admit my defeat. Please find me the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Crystal Quartz Stone</FONT>! That's a crystal with real value. The minerals we've found couldn't even compare to it. Hurry off to gather. Don't flutter around me.
Fine fine fine, I know you are capable, my hero!
Don't think you've become a mineral specialist just because you've found the Gleaming Ice Stone. You still have far to go! If you can't find what I want you to look for next, I will not respect your capabilities.
Stop spewing nonsense!
I don't respect you either!
Such a persistent person. Can I interpret that as hard-headed? Hahaha, this time go look for <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Crimson Crystal</FONT>! I have investigated and discovered that the Crimson Crystal is the hardest mineral around here, and they shine a crystalline light. If you can bring me that, I will recognize your capabilities.
It doesn't matter! I don't care about your respect. I just want to admire the beautiful minerals I seek.
You've done well. I can feel your energy, but those are the most common minerals in the area. Now I'll give you another test. Are you willing to take it?
Yes!
Why do I have to accept it?
You're such an odd person. You knew this is not a rewarding business. This time you go look for <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Gleaming Ice Stone</FONT>!
What determination! Great! I admire people like you, hahaha.
Is there something you want from me? I'm busy looking for rare minerals. Don't disturb me if it's not an emergency.
Do you need my help?
What are you looking for?
You helping me癒HOh please, there are no free lunches. You must be here to plunder my rare minerals! However, if you insist on helping me, I need to see if you have an eye for appraising these stones. Please bring me some <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Ice Crystals</FONT>! When I first saw these crystals, I find them sparkly, and when I came here, I realized the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Ice Crystals</FONT> are everywhere. Please go look for the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Ice Crystals</FONT> to prove your capabilities!
I'm looking for sparkling minerals from all over the world. I wish I could build a <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Mineral Museum</FONT>, and collect all the rare minerals from all over the world.
This place is wonderful. Sparkling gems and minerals are everywhere. If I could, I'd to buy this place and send specialists to mine them.

HAHAHA... Won.der.ful!   This is a milestone in my life of monster research. I can use artificial ways to create new monsters! Although they still can't move freely, the person on the portrait can now blink his eyes. I have to show them to my research teammates!  You go get my results to my colleagues!

Still don't see it! hehehe... Why can''t I see what makes the portraits move from the Devil Flame Portrait?  Right, perhaps the reason lies with the paint? Most of the paint from the canvas you've brought back last time have fallen off. We don't have enough to study. I need more materials. You go defeat <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Spiritually Diverging Portrait</FONT> and scrape me <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>10 packs</FONT> of <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Rotten Smell Powder</FONT>! heehee...

hohoho... Young man, have you studied the details of how monsters appear? It is a mysterious and interesting thing, hohoho... Maybe You still couldn't see it at the moment. When you reach <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>level 50</FONT>, we will chat again. hoho...

It's fine, but what's that?
I don't want to touch that.
You want to know? Go take it apart with Simath.
Your back pack is full. Go clear some space!
What do you mean by questionable origin! This is my great research!
Gihaha... Just leaving behind the fillings. What can we use... Oh yes! You go defeat the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Garm</FONT> and get me <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>30 bottles</FONT> of <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Golems Blood</FONT>. It's monsters' structures. It must be interchangeable!   Gihaha...
Eh... Fine! I'll get them.

That thing isn't as scary as you thought! Go get me some! Gihaha...
Now I need ingredients that guides aura. You go defeat <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Nimble Lizard Man</FONT> and slice <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>25 bunches </FONT>of <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Lizard Thorns</FONT> for me. Tthe nearer to the roots, the better. Gihaha...
Take the request.
I don't want to touch that...
Gihaha... You know where to find me.
As long as it's not the poisonous Lizard Thorn, don't worry about touching the Lizard Man! Gihaha...
"Then for the next step, we need materials that will prevent the joints from rotting... Gihaha... Defeat <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Lizard Man</FONT> and get <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>20 pieces</FONT> of their <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Grudge fabric</FONT> .

Fine.
This doesn't seem right...
Go go! After all, those cloth fragments are from the people they have killed. Gihahahaha...
You think too much! Gihaha...
Gihaha... You've finally come? You look a little stronger. Ready to enjoy the exhilaration of chopping up monsters with me?  Lately, obstacles have cropped up in my research. I want to use some unusual research materials to help me achieve some breakthrough.
What do you want from me?
This... Let me think about it.
Then we'll start with Heavenly Holy Spirit. Go defeat the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Heavenly Holy Spirit</FONT> and get me <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>15 pieces </FONT>of <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Green Stained Bronze</FONT>. Gihaha...
I guess I will do it.
I... I'm allergic to that.
Go! Don't waste time. Gihaha...
Gihaha... This is an unbelievable excuse! Come back to me when you've made up your mind.
Well that's fine, gihaha... I'm always here.
Gihaha... Want to know how it feels to cut monsters into large pieces? It's exhilarating!   Umm... Your arms are too thin. It doesn't look like you could do it. Come back to me when you have reached <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>level 50</FONT>. Gihaha...

Thanks to you. I've sent someone to take the items back. Please be careful on your adventures. Don't get into accidents.
Everything has been smooth till now. How should I thank you for what you've done! Just get the last item and I could satisfy my clients! Please defeat <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Merman of the Mud Pond</FONT> and take <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>20 bunches</FONT> of <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>MudLake Fish Whisker</FONT> from them!
Seems weird, but okay!
I refuse.
Please be careful in this last stage.
Ah! What should I do next?
Thank you for your assistance. The next item I wish you could get me is <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Black Shark Fin</FONT>. Unlike normal shark fins, they come from <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Merman of the Black Sea</FONT>. Please collect <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>10 pieces</FONT> for me.
I'm on a weird one again!
I refuse.
<font COLOR=#00ff00>Merman of the Black Sea</FONT> is not near extinct or protected specie. Don't worry!
Ah! What should I do next?
The next task I hope you'd do is to collect <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Dead Mermaids Scales</FONT>. I need a total of <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>25 pieces</FONT>. They come from the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Merman of the Dead Sea</FONT>.
Are scales edible? Fine.
I refuse.
I thank you for your help!
Ah! What should I do next?
Hero, please listen to me. I am a trader specializing in transporting special foods and herbs. A ship scheduled to come to the harbor lost its traces. Without the shipment, I would lose my clients' trust, so I must go look for my goods at their origins.
How should I help you?
Really? Good luck to you.
Can you hunt me some demons from around this area? My client wants to use them to make special dishes.
Are those edible? Fine.
You should find a hunter.
I am so grateful to you! Please defeat the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Merman</FONT> and bring me the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Merman's Scale</FONT> from their backs. I need <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>20 pieces</FONT> in total.   Please be very careful!
Sob sob... Would there be another kind hearted hero come help me?
Hero, please help me! My whole family depends on this transaction!
What to do, what to do? I have never been in so much trouble. How I wish a hero at <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>level 50</FONT> or above could come and rescue me!

I am grateful to you. I've lived but carried the burden of the name of refugee until now, and now I have finally did something for them. When my time comes, I should be able to face them in the other world...
The final task... Defeat <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Hell's Magician</FONT>. They were the commanders of the attack force. Don't mention the Intermediate Soldiers. Even our Commanders were no match for their magic... Please, you must retrieve <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>10 pieces</FONT> of <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Captain's ID</FONT> from them.
Take the request.
I don't want to help.
This is the last of the last. Please be careful when you face your enemies.
So that's it... I couldn't do anything since I've been troubling you until now.
Our third batch have encountered the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Insane Witch</FONT>. Please at least retrieve <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>15 pieces</FONT> of <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Intermediate solder's ID</FONT> for me.
Take the request.
I don't want to help.
Then I will leave it to you. Please be careful.
Is that so... Then let's leave it as this...
Thank you for what you've done for an old man. The next task I need you to complete is to defeat the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Harpy of the Dark Star</FONT> and retrieve <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>20 pieces</FONT> of <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Elementary solder's ID</FONT>. Although we have sent soldiers of matching ranks to fight the different degrees of demon's, sadly we still lost...
Take the request.
I don't want to help.
Then I will leave it to you. Please be careful.
Is that so... Then let's leave it as this...
Young man, are you willing to hear the request of a coward?
Tell me first.
I'm busy,
I... I have ran away from this battlefield! At that time my team of warriors was eliminated. I was the only survivor because I was too embarrassed to head back. I wandered around here. For decades... Now my lonely wanderings are going to stop as my life ends. Are you willing to help a dying old man take revenge?
What do you want me to do?
Stop minding these things.
At that time we've encountered demons we were unfamiliar with. That's why we were overwhelmed. Please defeat <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Ditch Swamp Demon</FONT> for me and retrieve <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>25 pieces of</FONT> <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Lower level soldier's ID</FONT>.
How mean of you to talk to an old man like this...

I'm not that desperate to leave now that everything is packed and we're ready to go any time. How strange, hahaha...

Well, fine!
I refuse.
Cough cough, I have lost myself again. Then I'll leave everything to you!

You've finished half the task. Go defeat the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Magical Horned Gigantes</FONT> and bring me <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>15</FONT> <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Horn of Devil Giant</FONT>.
You are so demanding!

Sorry, sorry, I was so happy I lost myself.
Hey! You've done a half. Ddon't give up now!
Thanks for helping me. Now please defeat <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Blood Ring Gigantes</FONT> for me and bring me <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>30 pieces of</FONT> <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Bloody Giant Claw</FONT> to take home as proof.
There are quite a lot, fine.
I refuse.
Then I will leave it to you!
Don't leave. I can't go back to my home town like this!
I was being teased in my home town. They called me the liar Antoll. Three months ago I professed my love to a girl. I've sworn to her that I will defeat the Giants here, to prove that I am a strong and dependable man.  But...
But what?
I'm not interested in liars
But... I realize I am not as strong as I thought, and I've not even defeated one giant. Are you willing to help me fulfill my promise?
I don't like it, but fine!
Be responsible for your lies
Really?that's wonderful!   There are quite a few clans of giants living in this area. Please defeat the weakest <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Gigantes</FONT> for me, and remember to bring me <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>20 bunches of</FONT> <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Giants Hair</FONT> to take home as proof.
I came here because I want to fulfill my promise... Weep...
Sigh, no one's willing to help me?
How should we defeat the Giants? If I have someone at <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>level 55</FONT> or above at my side, it'd be great.

Thanks to you, I finished the boss's assignments. If I have to collect those myself, I couldn't even come back alive.
Lastly please defeat <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Little Mr. Fruit</font> and collect <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>25 Thick Fruit Juice</FONT>, Boss said that fragrance of these juices never fade, so he wants to use them to make bricks that smells. This way we won't have to use fresheners in the house.
Take the request.
I refuse.
Although these are unreasonable requests, but thanks for helping out.
Ah... Then I shall ask others for help. Thank you.
The next material to collect is from <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Little Mr. Earth</font>. I need <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>25 Core Stone Mr. Earth</font>. The boss said that by mixing the fragments of these core stones with clay, you can get some extremely firm bricks.
Take the request.
I refuse.
Be careful when you are on your way.
Ah... Then I shall ask others for help. Thank you.
Thanks for your help. The next material I need is from the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Stealing Ahrimans</FONT>. I need <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>20 Color Shells</FONT>. The boss said that the natural colors on them are best materials for ornamental windows.
Take the request.
I refuse.
I thank you again for your help.
Ah... Then I shall ask others for help. Thank you.
This hero, my boss owns a shop that sells construction materials. Lately he has been asking me to collect some strange items. I wonder if you are interested in helping me out?
Tell me what to do.
I refuse.
First I need to defeat the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Seizure Ahriman</FONT> and get 15 pieces of their <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Transparent Shell</FONT>. The boss said that these are good for letting the light through and have a firm texture. It's a material ready to be made into windows.
Take the request.
I refuse.
Really, that's great. Thanks for coming to my aid.
So... I'll ask others to help.
Sorry for taking your time.
Ah... My boss is making me do such a difficult task. I need a hero at <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>level 55</FONT> or above to complete this task!

You've already proven your capabilities, but your spirit needs more development. Go and train yourself. One day you will understand the true meaning of battles.
I look forward to your development! As for your last test, go defeat the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Hell Knight</FONT> and bring me <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>20 pieces</FONT> of <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Hell Knights Weapon</FONT> as proof.
Accept
I refuse.
You only have the last stage to go.
Don't be a coward who runs away from battles!
My impression of you now changes from the first impression. Maybe you can satisfy my expectations. Your next challenge is to defeat the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Devil Knight</FONT>, and bring back <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>10 pieces</FONT> of <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Devil Knights Weapon</FONT>, and that'd be all.
Accept
I refuse.
Go, only the hardest battles can create a true hero.
Don't fail the most recent impression I have of you.
You did well on your first stage. The next one will be more of a challenge. There are <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Dark Knights</FONT> nearby. Have you seen them? This won't be as simple as the previous stage. You go and defeat them and bring back <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>25 pieces</FONT> of  <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Dark Knights Weapon</FONT> .
Accept
I refuse.
Go. Coming back alive alone can prove your capabilities.
The challenge just started and you want to give up? So that's all you've got.
I train in this dangerous place to push my battle skills to a higher level. You look quite capable. Are you interested in a bit of an exchange?
You want to fight?
Not interested.
Of course you're not fighting me. Danger lurks everywhere here. Don't show your weakness for others to attack. But there are quite a lot of <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Evil Knights</FONT> around. You go and defeat them and bring me <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>20 pieces</FONT> of  <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Evil Knights Weapon</FONT>  to prove your powers? How about that?
Then that's what we'll do!
I refuse.
Then let's chat when you come back alive.
Oh, so you don't want to test your powers?
Hoho, so you plan to simply escape?
Oi! You! With one look at you, I know that you haven't reached <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>level 65</FONT>. Don't wander around here. It's very dangerous. If something happened, I won't be there to save you.

Carve the ice into snowflake shapes. Then pour some jam on... It's true that the most basic foods are the most tasty!  Ah, it's you. When I open my tasting counter, you have to come!
What a shame. Although the Green Stones are made into boxes, there are still cracks that leak out the cold air. I need to find things to block these cracks.  Can you bring me <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>20 pieces of</FONT> <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Wet Gauze</FONT>. This can also be found on the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Snow Banshee</FONT>.
Take the request.
I refuse.
We're almost done! Hurry back!
This is the last step, don't let it halt!
Although the boxes can lower the temperature, the lowering stops when it reaches a certain degree. I think it's because the box's materials couldn't insulate the insides from the outside temperature. Can you deafeat some <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Little Ms. Fallen</font> and take <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>15 pieces</FONT> of <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Green Stones</FONT> from them? <PF>I've heard that these stones don't change temperature with its environment. We should be able to make a suiable container with them?
Take the request.
I refuse.
Whether I can create a new desert depends on you.
Just a bit more, work hard...
Although the Snow Gem Core you brought back last time can lower the temperature, the area it can influence is not big enough. If the air in the container can be in constant contact with the core, we should be able to lower the temperature of everything in the container.   Can you defeat the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Wind Harpy</FONT> and take <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>20 breaths of</FONT> <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Wind Harpy's Breath</FONT>?
Take the request.
I refuse.
Whether I can create a new desert depends on you.
Ah, we've finally taken our first step, and now this...
I am a dessert chef, and am thinking about new creations lately. I think as I wander, and when I came to my senses, I'm in a strange place... But it gave me inspiration. You want to hear about it?
Sure.
I don't want to know.
My idea's like this: it'd be great to be able to eat cold sweets in the summer! I discovered that there are all sorts of ice-type monsters in this area. If we can make a box which is similar to their bodies, then we can make cold sweets whenever we like!     I want to find some materials and try it out. Can you bring me <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>15 pieces</FONT> of  <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Snow Gem Core</FONT>  癒H It's from the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Little Snowman</FONT>.
Seems interesting, sure.
I refuse.
Thank you. Since this core can concentrate the coolness that makes up the Little Snowman, I think it should be able to lower the temperature of the dessert.
What a shame, this is an original idea.
What a shame.
We can have ice anywhere on this Ice Field, but during the hot seasons, we'll feel differently! I have an idea, as long as I have a <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>level 65</FONT> or higher hero to help me, I can realize this dream!

Grrrr... Did you think that the process of life is like the bundling up of infinitite strands?
Hm, it did seem that way.

Seems like you still haven't given the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Crystal of Millenium Mushroom</FONT> to Tanshue. Then let me keep the Crystal so you can come back to me when you are free.
Wow! You're surprisingly powerful. Well..... I have finally finished my own adventure mission. Maybe now we can help <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Tanshue</FONT> realize her dream.

The last ingredient is a rare metal. It's hard to get, but I know that the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Sea Centaur's</FONT> spear is made of such metal, If you can bring me <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>3 Sea Centaur's Spear</FONT>, I can complete making my <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Ice Blade Shoes</FONT>. So please bring me <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Sea Centaur's Spears</FONT>.
Hm.. I don't think the last material will be easy to acquire. Maybe you should give up before losing your life in the cave.
Legend says that to breathe holiness into weapons, we need some demon's bones. You brought me <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Demon Hand Skeleton</FONT> before, but I think I will need something else as well. You need to bring more materials before we can go to the next stage.
What's missing?
I'm tired. I want to rest.
I'm so happy you are here to help. According to my studies of the caves, the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Evil Spirit of the Coral-Colored Koto</FONT> have high quality auras. I need <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>6 Coral Demon Skeleton Bones</FONT> before I could go to the next stage. I'll leave you with the mission of getting the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Coral Demon Skeleton Bones</FONT>.
The <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Magical Hands</FONT> are very powerful monsters as well. You're quite something to be able to get his bones. You can rest a while before we proceed to the next stage.
I'll tell you everything. Challenging the ultimate speed has always been my dream, but to make this dream come true, I need another important equipment. I will need more people to gather and synthesize materials for me to speed up the process of getting this equipment. I can use the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>materials </font>I collected to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>make my equipment</FONT> myself. <PF>This is a very important mission. Could you do this for me? Of course I will reward you accordingly... Are you interested?
Ok! Let me help!
Sorry, I'm not interested.
I have to collect and create materials to make the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Ice Blade Shoes</FONT>. If the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Ice Blade Shoes</FONT> are completed successfully, I could attempt to challenge the ultimate speed on the ice fields.<pf>As the first material, I need you to bring me <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>10 Demon Hand Skeletons</FONT>,  This is one of the materials for crafting the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Ice Blade Shoes</FONT>. Meanwhile I have to prepare tools to synthesize the materials for the Shoes.
Then nevermind. I think I will go look for others for help~
I am <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Tanshue</FONT>. Ultimate speed has always been my aim. Right now I am training in this cave,  It seems like you have gone through quite some training too. How about I give you a <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>tiny challenge</font>? Are you willing to take it?
Great, I'll take the challenge.
I don't train for same goal.
Great! Two types of monsters reside in this southern cave: the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Ice Goblin</FONT> and <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Drunken Cat</FONT>. These two monsters are annoying. One of them is bad with alcohol. The other one love to drink, and it distracts everyone when it's drunk. Their chaotic behavior distracts me. If you can defeat those two for me, maybe I can have you help me with challenging the ultimate speed.
I thought so too. After all, everybody's dreams differ. Using my own legs to find ultimate speed on the ice field is my dream.
You haven't been trained enough. Go back for more practices.

I am free~~~ I can finally move freely!  The curse on me is broken.
Although I already had the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>curse prevention</FONT> tools, my body still refuses to listen to me. How hateful!!!  I tried a lot of ways to make my arms and legs move, but my body just won't move. How I long to destroy this Wicked King... <pf>Sigh~~~ If you still have something you need help with, <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>look for Chaewa</FONT>.. Maybe she could help you with something...
I can finally speak, my beloved <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Chaewa</FONT>. I truly love her. When she was looking after me, I know exactly what she was doing. Just that I cannot speak or move, my poor <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Chaewa</FONT>. Oh, I've heard that you are the hero who <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>broke my spell</FONT>. Although at the moment <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>I can only speak but not move</FONT>, I thank you. <pf>The cause of my curse... is <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>True Abadon</FONT> encounter. The <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>True Abadon</FONT> started off by attacking us. My comrades and I did our best to fight back, But at the end, I was the only one left, because my comrades were hit by <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>True Abadon</FONT>'s <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>curse attack</FONT>. I was injured as well, but I was more fortunate. I fell down the cliff, and was washed down the river until I reached the place where the villagers found me.<pf>I want to return to the hill to see if any of my comrades survived. However I cannot move right now. Could you help me find them?
I will find them for you.
It sounds too scary.
Thank you~ However, there is one thing which I would rather you didn't talk about <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Chaewa</FONT>. Actually, I hope we're capable of <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>revenge</FONT> for those who lost their lives, but getting rid of the Demon is not so simple... <PF>I accidentally overheard a secret about this Demon from a conversation between other monsters.. That is... If you want to defeat it, this can only be done if a <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>special item</FONT> is obtained. Using the special items, it is said that one can dodge <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>haunt attacks</FONT> of the Demon. <PF>But in order to avoid unnecessary sacrifices, you should first try to find <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Kamikaze Penguin</FONT>, and wipe them out to collect <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>5</FONT> <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Penguin eggs</FONT>. If you can do this, then I will tell you about the next key item.
You got that right!  I feel it's the best not to go challenge them just yet, before we have a full grasp of the situation. For now I will go find the others.

I had no idea that you would actually be able to undo the curses of <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Orthy</FONT>. You also revenged for the villagers who had been killed in battle with <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>True Abadon</FONT>,  I believe that from now on there will be no more innocent victims. I am so grateful to you.
Hi, I heard from <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Orthy</FONT> that you had gone up into the mountains to search for the whereabouts of the other partners, but I didn't hear how it turned out. By the way, I went again to ask the elders if there is any way to completely undo all curses applied on the body of <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Orthy</FONT>,  I heard that there only was one way to undo all curses on <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Orthy</FONT>... And that is to kill the Demon <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>True Abadon</FONT>...
I will kill this demon!
I'm too weak to fight.
I think this task is very dangerous, you must take every caution and be sure to return safely. I hope to hear good news from you, and I wish you a safe journey.
This mission is very troublesome, you must make sure your safety is the priority.  If you are not an experienced traveler, then it would be better if you don't try it at all.
It looks like we can only dispel the mute curse on <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Orthy</FONT> for now, I still thank you for your aid. What's happened in the mountains? Where are his companions? May you go there and investigte? Once you talk with <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Orthy</FONT> again, you might be able to know more. It benefits you, I think.
You seem to have thought through this well, you've probably had a lot of experience with such situations, It should not be difficult for you to find out <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Orthy</FONT> that this person next to me is the dearest person to me that I know. Woooooooooo, Woooooooooo, Woooooooooo~~~<pf>One day he went up the mountains as usual together with partners in the village for hunting, but they did not return. After a week passed, someone found <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Orthy</FONT> who has become unable to move, He took him back to the village. Henceforth <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Orthy</FONT> was no longer himself, <pf>I had once heard the elders say that there was a group of monsters living in the mountains. Many villagers who went up into the mountains to hunt but never came back. The villagers who, by good luck, did manage to return, couldn't move thier body just like <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Orthy</FONT>. It was just like being <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>cursed</FONT>. <pf>I heard the elders of the village say that the curse can in fact be undone. I would like to entrust you to help me undo <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>the curses of Orthy</FONT>. Would you be able to do this?
I will help!
Sounds a little scary...
I am really thankful to you,  Elders of the village said <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Crazy Penguin Foot</FONT> is needed,  Maybe it can <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>undo curses applied to Orthy </FONT>,  I wish it really able to undo curses.
You poor dear, <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Orthy</FONT>. Be patient for a while more. I can only look around to see if there is anyone else who is willing to help,  Woooooo~~~
I understand you don't want to take this adventure any further. If you insist on pressing forward now, the consequences could be disastrous,  My dear lover <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Orthy</FONT> is a living example of what could happen,  Wooooo~~~

I am very lucky that I can see my poor wife again<FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Ursula</FONT>,  I really love her, hundreds of years have passed, and to finally be with her once again,  I am so grateful to you!  Um, Um, Um...
<font COLOR=#00ff00>The Antidote</FONT> was finally made!!!  But I figured I will just stay here, in <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Waterfall Tunnel</FONT>. My body still remains as that of a small child, It is impossible for me to defeat <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Apollo</FONT> like this, so I think it impossible for me to meet with <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Ursula</FONT>.
I can help you
I am really very sorry
Really?!  I am so touched, if I can seeUrsulaI will be satisfied,  if I really can beat <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Apollo</FONT> down and save Ursula,  I will give you <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>lifelong savings</FONT>.
My poor <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Ursula</FONT>, I will be certain to think again about how to save you.
After interpretation, I just learned that in fact the antidote preparation also needs <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Monster Crabs Skin</FONT>. So long as I obtain <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Monster Crabs Skin</FONT> that antidote can be completed. I must trouble you again to ask you to help me gather<FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Monster Crabs skin</FONT>. Thanks very much~
Monster Crabs Skin it is..
I think I need to rest.
It's really too good, there seems there is a date that I will soon meet with <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Ursula</FONT>,  but the awesome <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Apollo</FONT> forcibly abducted away my wife in the beginning,  I must extricate <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Ursula</FONT>, so I beg you to bring me the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Monster Crabs Skin</FONT>.
<font COLOR=#00ff00>Monster crabs Skin</FONT> seems really fierce, I think I need a rest.
I have made the antidote according to the prescription tab, but the symptom can not be gotten rid of permanently,  I first go to ask <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>kindhearted Fairy Pumpkin</FONT>, then I studied to find out where the problem is?  Maybe the problem can be found out through an answer from the speaking <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Beast Pumpkin</FONT>,  I don't know if you would like to help me?
No problem!
Speaking Pumpkin???
I have an answer now, kind Fairy Pumpkin told me that I must get <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Information of the Millennium Pumpkin</FONT> in advance, <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>give it to the kind Fairy Pumpkin</FONT> for an interpretation, then I can know the prescription for making the antidote.
Really! <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Millennium Pumpkin</FONT> often gabbles and sounds very strange,  Maybe it is the language that he uses to communicate.
Don't look at me like a liitle boy, actually I have stayed here for several years,  My partner and I have wanted to undo the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Monster Puzzle</FONT>, so my adventure brought me here,  But now I am separate from my lover<FONT COLOR=#00ff00> Ursula</FONT>, because she was captured by <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Apollo</FONT>, I want to save her,  But... Can you help me find the method to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>remove instant aging</FONT>?
So do I help you first?
You are telling a lie!
You must be curious why I need to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>remove instant aging</FONT>.. As long as I <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>leave</FONT> this place, my body will rapidly recover to the physiological status of my real age, so if I am to leave this place and save <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Ursula</FONT>, I must recover my normal body. I heard that<FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Wing of Blue Bat</FONT> could relieve my normal body. Could I trouble you to help me collect <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>five</FONT> <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Wings of Blue Bat</FONT>? Thank you.
It's true!!! Do I not know what is the cause?  My body looks like a child, but I have actually been here for more than three hundred years.
Oh~~~ I think you shouldn't force yourself to enter into this <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Waterfall Tunnel</FONT> with your abilities at present.

The climate of this illusionary land has gradually recovered to normal, so it seems that you have experienced the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>La</FONT>, I don't know if you have ever seen spectacular <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Pyramid</FONT>, it is said that there are <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>endless treasures</FONT> in this tower, However the monster in this tower is very horrible, so I hope you proceed with everything carefully.
How strange! Your body unexpectedly has the legendary <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Crystalline Mirror</FONT>,  You don't know if it is true or not? It is good to first be certain about this, is it true or false?
It is a legend that there is a <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Crystalline Mirror</FONT> in this illusionary land which has been shining onto the snow of the Tianshan Mountains. The snow cover that is being shined on by <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Crystalline Mirror</FONT> doesn't melt, but actually the melting speed of snow slowed down so that this illusionary land can maintain such a scence. But the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Crystalline Mirror</FONT> has been stolen, do you wish to help me reclaim the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Crystalline Mirror</FONT>?
I want to see it!
Does it really exist?
After my investigation, <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>the Crystalline Mirror</FONT> was stolen by the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Flower Fairy</FONT>,  We may have to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>get rid of the Flower Fairy</FONT>, so that we can find <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>the Crystalline Mirror</FONT>.
This is a treasure from ancient times,  this mirror is really miraculous, it occupies an indispensible status in order to maintain the environment of this illusionary land.
The thing doesn't seem so simple, because <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Fairy of the Ultimate Light</FONT> still has a <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Fairy twin</FONT>. All illegal activites were done by both of them together,  We have to find another monster, and things will be ok only we also have her <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>wiped</FONT> out.
Let's work on it together
It seems too difficult
Oh well! Having patience and perseverance is essential for being an adventurer. At present, I know the names of those Fairy Twins, just call them as <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Fairy of the Underground</FONT>,  I think they probably won't be easy to cope with, we may need to find more people, let's make an extra effort in this together.
Come on~~~ We just killed several monsters, you have become lost,  I think there is still a long way to go for you.
I think you have found out that there are some animals that have gone crazy and will actively attack humankind, I was almost attacked, however after I tamed several animials, I found that many animals had been bamboozled by monsters and no longer work hard, I think to return the weather to normal, we must find the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>monster</FONT> who has done this. <PF>As for the task of <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>finding monsters</FONT> and <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>getting rid of monsters</FONT>, I don't know if you have any interest or not? If completed successfully, I will give you many rewards.
Rewards? I like that!
Monsters are scary.
I knew you would agree to help me, you are really brave, BR>Now~I pried into a message, it is the reason why <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Ninja Racoon Dog</FONT> no longer works hard, because many <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Ninja Racoon Dog</FONT> ate <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>confusing pears</FONT>, then they became very bad tempered in their personalities, and these pears were planted by <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Fairy of the Ultimate Light</FONT>, so we must get rid of <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Fairy of the Ultimate Light</FONT>.
It only takes a few monsters to frighten you to that extent!?  In my opinion you need to learn to deal with more!
Originally in such a frozen place, mountain springs are continuously flowing out of the mountains endlessy, air temperature also stays at a generally cold level... But I don't know why the air temperature has gradually become warmer than before in this place in these past few years. The mountain springs that poured out are very unstable, many ups and downs, and this has caused my ice skating time to be shortened each year. <PF>If this continues, I think it will really become very terrible, this will result in as large a disaster as the heavens. I don't know if you want to assist with me in <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>investigating the reasons for the climate becoming abnormal</FONT>?
Let me assist you
Maybe you think too much.
Very good! Let's carry this out separately. I will go to look for <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Ninja Racoon Dog</FONT> who is working on mountains in order to look at the reasons. I will also go to look for other animals to see if other clues exist.
What is it that I think about too much, please forget about it if you don't want to hep me!

Is it true what the boss has said about you? My god! I don't believe it!
Boss... Boss, this just regards that you blow me away!   Since I am now one of your party members,   It should be natural and right that you help me, your party member!
Um... A simple thing!
Hum.. I just don't agree with it!
No No No, this matters relates to human lives! My dearest elder sister,  This time was unexpectedly selected as the Saint Lady for this time... That is to be dedicated as the sacrificial offering to <FONT COLOR=#ffad5b>Rock Ling Yan Ling Spirit</FONT> who is guarding <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>the rocky plateau</FONT>...
What, is there such a thing?
I never heard of such a thing!
We are a Clan that guards Stone Temple Seal for each generation, although we belong under the Four Great Civilizations, but we still have our own tradition.   <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Rocky Plateau</FONT>'s Seal, there has been a little crack early due to attacks from monsters each day for several hundreds of years. <PF>People in the Clan think, because the strength of the Soul Stone Spirit has become weak, the seal becomes weak; otherwise how can those dirty monsters break the seal and enter into <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Rocky Plateau</FONT> to cause such a disturbance? Those monsters still make the spirits of the plain so dirty!
So?
In order to allow the Soul Stone Spirit to recover its strength, people of our clan have unexpectedly decided, every three years. To choose the purest girl with strongest potential ability to be offered as a sacrificial offering to the Soul Stone Spirit. So that the Soul Stone Spirit recovers its spiritual force, consolidating the seal once more! <PF>However so many girls have been sacrificed, the seal still cracks little by little, which seems no effect at all! But the Witch of our clan unexpectedly said that humankind force is too weak and we are not so sincere. So the Soul Stone Spirit recovers slowly... I have no patience for this thing! Especially because the girl selected this time is my favorite elder sister,  I would never see her be sarcrificed! Boss, can you help me save her? Please do me a favor!
What do you want me to do?
You just wait slowly!
Since you said that, I will regard it as your agreement with me!  My older sister has a man she loves, that man is Brother <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Lei</FONT>, in order to save my older sister, he disobeyed the clan chief, Now we are being pursued by our own clan members. I beg you to look for him, he needs your help very much! Now he is hiding in <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Rolling thunder cave</FONT> of <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Thunder Hill</FONT>, which is very secret and not easy to find. <PF>Boss! I give you this knife, when Brother <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Lei</FONT> sees this knife, he will naturally know you as the man to whom I have entrusted this task.
Please do me a favor, my Boss~~~ Brother <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Lei</FONT> now must be waiting for us very anxiously in <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Thunder scrolling cave</FONT>. Wait for our help to save my elder sister!
Boss! Can you allow me to find a place to leave this trivial knife?
Wait a moment, boss, you are the only one I can trust! Other people can not win me even with a finger-guessing game, I never believe in their abilities at all and only you, my boss, can convince me, please do me a favor and help me save my elder sister!
Although we belong under Four Great Civilizations, but actually we are the clan that guards the stone temple seal. We have our own tradition and acting methods, it should be as a matter of course that you may never hear this!

Just got a chance to sneak out to inquire about news, as a result I encountered a girl at Royal Bird. Her eyes looked empty, no spirit. By just a glance I knew her soul was lost. You see her mother crying, she so heartbroken. I actually want to help you very much. It's a pity that I have a heart but no strength now, furthermore <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Gobihi</FONT> is still waiting for me. People are selfish, I can only take care myself at this moment.
Gobihi... No! Mimian Princess, waiting for me, I certainly will find a solution and escape from here. Friends, if you see her, would you please send her these words? Let her remain in her initial place, don't abandon me.
My poor <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Gobihi</FONT>... You are beautiful and splendid but still encountered such misfortune. Could it be that beauty is also some sort of mistake?
You have broken my heart, I now no longer believe in anyone!  My lover who pledged solemnly, my friend who helped me by risking his life... To my surprise they left me together... My heart has died... I no longer want to see you, you ought to go to look for <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Meryote</FONT>! Dirty liars like you should become good friends.

I will go there for you
Useless!
Good friends, thank you very much. I am sure have to help <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Gobihi</FONT> receive justice, otherwise how can I live up to her good soul?
I believe she's still alive
Well said
Ah! Yes! How can I give up easily?  Maybe my lover <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Gobihi</FONT> remains in another place and is waiting for me to save her... I can not easily discard my life. Good friend, I beg you, please go to see Meryote, with your eloquence and your power. You must be able to get him to take back his cruel order, and send people to retrieve the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Gobihi</FONT>!
I will go right now
I'm wasting my time.
So grateful to you! There is a known friendship between the prophets of <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Meryote</FONT> and <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Wizard's Cave</FONT>. You should go there and find him.
Uh-huh! Do you not wish to help us?  If you really feel awkward, then I guess I have no choice but to find a way to brave the dangers by myself in order to meet him!
My poor <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Gobihi</FONT>... You are beautiful and splendid but still encountered such misfortune. Could it be that beauty is also some sort of mistake?
Even if useless, even though I may be killed due to this, I would still do so without protest!

Brother <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Lei</FONT>, he... Uhh Uh, he is really so foolish!  Why is he so sentimentally attached to me, I am not worthy of his love! Now he himself remains at <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>rolling thunder cave</FONT>! But my sister... No, no, it will ok only if I have to stop this thing. In fact... This... This is a secret of our monster clan, I shouldn't tell you, but if I don't say what it is, <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Lei</FONT> and <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Couple Lay</FONT> certainly will encounter dangers... What should I do? <PF>In order to save their lives, I must speak out. Please listen carefully. Mimian Princess lost <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Life Blessing Beads</FONT>, and flew into a rage. Then she came back to Hell and reported this matter to the King of the Monster Clan. After the King of my clan knew this, the King decided to send <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Asmodians Big Ghost</font> to break through the Enchantment of <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Wastelands</FONT>, and exterminated two towns at one stroke.
What should be done then?
Oh so terrible
You don't look down upon this Big Ghost. He is a Temperess <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Evanescent Red</FONT> coming from hell. He gathers the souls and spirits of humans, he is extremely strong! In particular, he can summon giant fires. As far as I know, he has broken through the enhancemenet of <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Wastelands</FONT>, and is ready to march upon other towns. <PF>Only you and I know about this thing. It is impossible to rebel against Asmodians by myself. I am not sure if I can even hurt him. Sigh...
Are you asking me to do it?
Stay at my heels
Don't worry about it. Although <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Evanescent Red</FONT> is very fierce, the enhancement of <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Wastelands</FONT> has some binding force to him; There is no volcano here, and thus no fire power to help him. His power can not be fully exerted. So long as you make use of proper tactics, I believe you should have favorable odds. <PF>In addition, I also believe you have enough capabilities to beat <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Evanescent Red</FONT>. I will wait here for your good news! Do your best.
You cannot possibly think so! If you have this idea in your heart, I will look down upon you.
No matter how terrible, we will still try our best to prevent this,  If not, the humans of these two towns will not survive, so you should not want to hold back!
Even you feel the same way!  Yes! People like me have been thoughtful and considerate, but the blood of the monster clan flows through my body,  Who will ever love me sincerely??
Please go far away! Don't come to bother me.
Ah! Does it have anything to do with you? Go away!
Hope my sacrifice will be valuable, but then... Oh! <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Lei</FONT> my lover, unfortunately I can not see him one last time.
Who are you? Go away, go away, don't touch me... Smelly monster! Go away--

For that last thing, I am really thankful to you, if you have any occasion where you need my help, please don't hesitate to tell me.
Ah, the friend of our clan, you come forward again with a sense of honor and justice! I wholeheartedly thank you.
Make your point directly!
I just came to visit
According to the Drunk <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Brat</FONT>, Gobihi is certainly very suspicious. There is still the woman engaged with her, who is very suspicious indeed. Hold on, I have a good idea, one that can test what kind of person <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Gobihi</FONT> is.
Please tell me.
Is she really that bad?
I must say, the Lay Family has gotten along with her for decades. Definitely there have been some emotions between them;  I don't know how she would react, if the Lay Family tragically encountered a sudden disaster.
I can't kill them for that!
It must be done for justice
No killing, just take their soul away!  <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Lei</FONT> has a misunderstanding with you. In order to avoid raising obstacles, you still should go to find <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Couple Lays</FONT>! This is <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Soul Trapping Pot</FONT>, so long as you summon, and get their responses, it can trap their souls into the pot. Afterwards, the soul should be able to return to its body without affecting the life. <PF>Remember, after the soul of <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Couple Lays</FONT> is trapped, you should take this pot to find <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Gobihi</FONT>;  You can say some seditious words to observe her reactions. <FONT COLOR=#ffad5b>I will be waiting here for your news, remember never to lose this</FONT> <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Soul Trapping Pot</FONT>.
You make a free slot in the bag, then I will tell you how to do it!
Uh! I just made a joke, you never take it seriously,  Ha--ha!
Before you prove them guilty, each person is innocent, I also feel so deeply. Friend, please never act on an impulse!
Ah? oh... Then please take your time.
Friends! Your face seems puzzled, looks uncertain, have you encountered some unsolvable thing?
Things seem strange
It's none of your business
Oh! My friend, do you mean the thing that Saint Lady sacrificed?  If I guess right, you should know where traitor Lei is hiding! Don't hurry, I will not force you. However, to see you coming here with a sad and frustrated face, you must have been bothered by something!  I advise you not to get involved in the love triangle, otherwise it will be difficult for you to escape it!
How do you know!
Do I seem like that?
Don't you feel it is weird that a slender and weak girl who can safely survive the ghost rampage in <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Wastelands</FONT>?  I don't think those evils will show mercy to the sacrificial victims of the Rock Spirit.
What do you mean?
Don't talk so wildly!
This matter seems very strange. The key especially lies at the body of <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Gobihi</FONT>; she is a child adopted by Lei's parents. She and <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Lei</FONT> were childhood sweethearts. Originally Lays wanted to wait for <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Gobihi</FONT> to grow up, then let the two of them get married. But recently, things seem changed. If you want to know the details, you can go to the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Entrance to Wastelands</FONT> to find <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Couple Lays</FONT>. <PF>At this moment they are wandering there, hoping to look forward to seeing <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Gobihi</FONT> coming back alive. Yes, that is selfless parental love...
If you don't believe me, why do you continue talking with me? Please go away immediately!
Friend, we have met only several times. Pardon me for failing to answer.
Uh-huh! It is really a good heart, but without a good report, no way, no way!
I am the Main Witch of Stone Temple Seal clan. I have to resume the important responsibility of continuing the specific habits of this clan. Who are you? Don't barge into this place, please go away immediately.

Courage of Warrior
<FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Warrior</FONT> is a job that requires a lot of courage, so if you want to be a Warrior, you'll need to prove you have courage worthy of being one. There is a cluster of monsters in <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Trial Cave</FONT> which is located to the northwest of Trial Field. There is a monster named <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Little Franken</FONT> who's been causing us a headache. If you could defeat them, it would be a great favor to the people. If you successfully complete this mission, I will admit that you have the bravery and strength necessary to be a Warrior!

Anxious Girl
San Joel's famous beautiful girl, <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Manalie</FONT>, has been looking worried recently. After more questions were asked, we found out her friend <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Jairo</FONT> fell strangely ill. What's worse is that it was not only him who got sick, but also many other people fell strangely ill. This disease has become a situation that got intensified gradually. What on earth has happened?
EXP x 10000, GP x 300
Go to the northeast of Snowzone for Jairo
Uh... Ah ah ah ah... Ao ao ao woooo... Ah ah ah...  Eh!? Who are you? Go away right now! Don't trouble me so rudely... Ah ah ah ah...
Then I go, bye!
You are ill, need any help?
Roll snap!    Uh... Ah ah ah ah... Ao ao ao wooo... Ah ah ah...
No... No... Uh uh... Go, go away quickly... Ah ah ah... Such pain!   You hurry up, no one can help me... I don't want to hurt you, but if you hold on, don't blame me then... Ah ah ah...
Since you insist...
Manalie sent me here!
Go, hurry up!   Uh... Ah ah ah ah... Ao ao ao wooo... Ah ah ah...
Mana, Manalie... Woooooo! Please go back to tell her, and make her forget about me! I was seriously injured, and there is no drug to treat it... In order not to hurt her and other dwellers, I can only hide here and wait for my death...  Ah ah ah ah... Such pain... My heart feels like it is burning up...
How were you injured?
I will pass on your message!
It's a long story... Several days ago, my good friend Ciroro and I went hunting, uh... But we encountered attacks of Werewolf... Ciroro... Wooo wooo... Died on the spot... And although I escaped, I was scratched by Werewolf... <PF>Originally I thought it to be only a small wound, but then, unexpectedly, after several days... I got hot flashes suddenly, pain all over my body, and wolf hairs growing up out from the wound... I... Uh uh... Snuck into San Joel's secret room of ancient books, checked through related books, then I know... As it turns out, if one is bitten by Werewolf... Uh uh... <PF>uh ah ah ah... My heaven! My heart... Is to burn up... Please do me a favor... Go back and tell Manalie, I love her... That will never change until I die...
Please do me a favor... Uh... Ah ah ah ah... Ao ao ao wooo... Ah ah ah...
Uh uh uh, I beg you, help me get my beloved Jairo back!
Go back to San Joel to find my Manalie
Did you see Jairo? How is he now? What on earth happened to him?
He said that he loved you~
Werewolf attacked him!
I certainly knew about him loving me, from his eyes which are clear as water and blue as the sea, I saw his love for me... But since he loves me so much, how can he be willing to make me alone and miserable?   Am I his lover? Just that and nothing more? Uh uh...
What! Hold me fast, I am swooning... You mean to say that he will very possibly... Die?   No--God cannot treat us so cruelly...
There would be a transit...
God just so cruel
No, I know that he will not fully recover... Uh uh... However, I still thank you, letting me know why Jairo left me...  At least I know he always loved me... Thanks...
Oh god! Why do you do so? Do you want to tear apart a pair of lovers like us...
Uh... Ah ah ah ah... Ao ao ao wooo... Ah ah ah...
Mysterious herb study
Legend says that there are lots of ancient books with rich data, that have been scattered across the world due to wars, of which one is <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Mysterious herb Study</FONT>, It is said that this book recorded plenty of information about treating diseases. In order to help Jairo, I was forced to ask <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Rosan, Ancient Books Administrator</FONT> for help!

Entrusted by Manalie to find Flat
Hey, my friend! Do you want to join our Ghost party ah... What? You said that you are entrusted by Manalie to come here? Ouch! It is really that sun rising in the west!   How come, could it be that little Manalie finally has found out that I am well and isn't willing to keep missing out? Does she want to dump Jairo, that little fly, and formally confess her love to me?
You think about it slowly!
Here's the thing...
I think so too! Hey hey hey... I think this is something that will happen sooner or later, you are right!
Originally Jairo, that little fly, was scratched by a Werewolf? Humph humph! He is a really useless thing, and cannot even cope with a trifling Werewolf. At first he refused my invitation, didn't join in the Ghost Party! <PF>If he was a member of the Ghost party, then he would have gotten along well with the Werewolf, and would never have gotten hurt! So I say that he suffered from his own actions. Since he is not my member, then why should I save him?
That is well said!
Because Manalie said...
Hey! You think so too! It seems that we share the same favor... No, it is Great Minds Think Alike...  How is it? Then do you want to join our Ghost party or not! There would be many benefits.
How come you didn't tell me earlier! Little Manalie wanted to date with me, so I am certainly willing to help her! Merely the object is that little Fly Jairo, I really don't want to help... That's all, we Ghost party members are always in the spirit of heart of cosmopolitanism and universal brotherhood, we should not formally reject anyone...   Well! I solely tell you the method of treating wounds caused by Werewolf. Now you go to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Soul School</FONT>, find a people named <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Rosan</FONT>, ask him <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>for the whereabouts of mysterious herb study</FONT>. This book records lots of prescriptions, of which there is one chapter to specially study Werewolf, refers to how to treat condition of injuries from Werewolf!    however this book was written in classical Chinese, so if you find this book, you must handwrite one copy of data to me, I will help you interpret, do you understand?
No! I dislike writing
Ok, I will go and return speedily
It's all up to you, at least the unlucky one is not me but Jairo! Hey!!
Take your time and it doesn't matter. At least I am not in a hurry! Hey hey!
Ugh! Go find the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Flat</FONT> for methods. I am not willing to help you, but I guess I still need to to save people!
Go to find Rosan, the Ancient Books Room Admnistrator
What to do? Don't come to bother me if it's not important, I am busy investigating into lost books!   I finally have gotten the whereabouts of several important books, you don't interrupt my work, go go go!
Where is this book?
Sorry...
Yoh~ It is really rare that current youths want to read books! OK! You tell me about what book you want to read?
Mysterious herb study
Sentimental Paradise
Lori's Doctor
Yoh~ Actually you are interested in medicine! Um um, there have not been many people like you eager to study! Very good, very good, it is like the old saying that coming early is not better than coming ingeniously, yesterday I just found the whereabouts of this book, now I can just happen to tell you. <PF>However you shouldn't be too happy just yet, it's ok only if you help me solve one thing. Have you ever heard of <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Gold Jiang Shi</FONT>? This terror zombie in legend has caused me disintegration of families, I had always pledged that I must remove him during my life so that I can get my family's revenge! <PF>But I am old and feeble, I really have no way to kill him, if you can help me kill the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Gold Jiang Shi</FONT>, help me get my family's revenge, I will tell you the whereabouts of <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Mysterious Herb Study</FONT>!
No!
I agree with you!
What! There you go...  Jingle, Doraemon... Your grandfather misses you very much...
<font COLOR=#00ff00>Gold Jiang Shi </FONT>just rage in <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Snowzone</FONT>. I don't know how many people have been killed by his claws!   Since you agree with me with such heroic spirit, I also believe in you. Go! I am waiting here for your news.
I see that you are <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>lanterning for dung--for feces!</FONT>   Go to paradise, you! Even more sentimental paradise~
Lori's Doctor? Do you want to see the doctor?   Why did you come here to find me? You should go to find veterinarian!
Go away go away! There always are people like you bothering me...
How!!? Didn't you get the prescription for treating the injuries done by Werewolf yet? Immediately go to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Soul School</FONT> to find <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Rosan</FONT>!   You are too slow and you are going to make me late for the date with little Manalie!
Ugh! Go find the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Flat</FONT> for methods. I am not willing to help you, but I guess I still need to to save people!
Return to Rosan after having struck down Gold Jiang Shi
Kill quest target: Gold Jiang Shi %d / %d
Good, good guy... I just heard news sent from Traveler, which said there was a Valiant having beheaded Gold Jiang Shi on snowfield, getting rid of Great trouble for our San Joel... That is you, right! <PF>Thank you for helping me taking the revenge... So thankful for you... Jingle, Doraemon... Your grandpa has entrusted a powerful warrior to help get your revenge... You can smile now... <PF>Since you achieved your promise, I tell you the whereabout of that book too. As far as I know, this book of <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Mysterious herb Study</FONT> was sealed in <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Amethyst Cave(North)</FONT>, I had always wanted to get back this book, but I also was afraid of destroying the integrity of this book, therefore I still left that book there. <PF>I have to remind you: it's ok that you look through this book, but you can not demage it. What you want to know, just recite them, otherwise you shoud use your hands to write down them, you know?
I don't know~
I will take care!
... I hope you you can cherish the antiquities. I cannot treat you nicely if you damage antiquities. I won't even consider for a second even if you are my benefactor!
Remember: What you want to know, just recite it, otherwise you should use your hands to write them down. Do NOT demage them.
Hateful <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Gold Jiang Shi</FONT> is still a harm to the world in <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Snowzone</FONT>. You must quickly go there to get rid of it! This is my sole condition.
How!!? Didn't you get the prescription for treating the injuries done by Werewolf yet? Immediately go to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Soul School</FONT> to find <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Rosan</FONT>!   You are too slow and you are going to make me late for the date with little Manalie!

Very good very good, I just like such young people like you loving to study and cherishing books! If there are any questions or you want to know whereabouts of any books, you are welcome to ask me again.
How come you still haven't gone to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Amethyst Cave(North)</FONT>? If you still haven't found the book, you should go look for it again more carefully. I am very much sure that <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Mysterious Herb Study</FONT> is still sealed in a crystal somewhere in the cave. You probably didn't look carefully.
Ugh! Go find the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Flat</FONT> for methods. I am not willing to help you, but I guess I still need to to save people!
Did you find it? Let me see! Wow~ These are written in mysterious characters! I mean, I'll have to take more spirits and power to interpret this content.  I really don't want to do this for nothing... I feel dizzy, I seem to lack<FONT COLOR=#00ff00>some spirit power</FONT>! If you could give me a bit of spirits, maybe I will be able to do this...
You think about it slowly!

You don't keep it well this time any more, I will not pay attention to you either. Jairo, the little fly, is nothing but an obstacle to me and Manalie, if he disappeared, contrarily it would be better for me!
Quickly take the Al made carefully by me to my little Manalie! Why do you still dawdle here? Ask her by the way which day we will date on?
Did little Manalie tell you which day she will have a date with you?    What? You didn't ask! You idiot! Hurry up to ask her.
Jairo out of Control
Under the help of Flat, I finally acquire <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Elixir of Ogre Flower</FONT> to treat Jairo; originally I think he will become better, but I know from Manalie, Jairo taking <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Elixir of Ogre Flower</FONT> unexpectedly becomes mad!

Jairo... Uh uh! A while after taking Elixir of Ogre Flower, Jairo completely loses his mind and becomes crazed, even wants to kill me! He loves me so much, how could he hurt me?    The sole reason is only one--he has been unable to control himself! What on earth's the matter? My god! Didn't you say that Elixir of Ogre Flower is the antidote? Why would Jairo become so? No no no no no...
It's none of my business...
I will immediately go!

I beg you, save him! I see him becoming strange to anyone even to me, my heart is in pain!    Please you go to prevent him from running out of the hiding place, I fear very much that he loses his mind, in that case he cannot really control hiself, escapes from Snowzone, must be found by others! I would not like him to hurt anyone, or get hurt by others!

Nothing, simply because you look repugnant!
You are a doctor making false medicine!
You are a bastard! Experience my power--Hu ha!
Ha? Do you say that Jairo, the little fly became crazed after taking my Elixir of Ogre Flower? How that could be! This Elixir of Ogre Flower was made by me in the spirits of a heart that our Ghost party <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>world relief, saving the world, compassion</FONT>, it is impossible that it would have a problem! I am quite confident in my medication making technique, unless you copied the description with errors, otherwise this Elixir of Ogre Flower is absolutely effective.   Ah ah ah!

What you gave me is <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>dried</FONT> Ogre Flower, you are sure!
No, it is abstracted then!
I forgot...
Awkward... Awful! Generally, ghosts or demons become top-grade, inner alchemy condensed in its body is often <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>strongly toxic</FONT>, if such an alchemy is not dried for detoxification, people taking it will <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>elixir field bursting</FONT> to death. I will go to pot! I must be punished by my party.   Although I dislike Jairo that little fly, but I don't want him to die in my hands... However, please you nothing but go to find that people!

Remember: you can neither come out with my name, nor tell why little fly be poisoned yoh! Do you understand clearly?
I know!
But I just have to speak out!
Thank you very much! I have many thanks unable to speak out in my hand.   Ah ah ah, this is a bit of kindly feelings of mine, please accept it kindly!
Feel embarrassed... Don't do this well! We have been so faimiliar with each other. And now it is most important to save that little fly, you don't waste time disputing with me!    Ah, this a bit of my kind feelings, please you don't get angry at me oh!
Ah ha ha ha... That must be dried.   In short, it's not my thing, I think it must be wolf toxicity infiltrating into the brain due to being delayed too much! It could be considered as bad luck for that little fly, it is as sure as fate lo! Ha ha ha ha--(lacking in confidence)

Recently this city doesn't seem very tranquil, I heard that there were many people had been infected with such a strange disease, and even there have been some people missing... Could it be possible that patients' family have patients...   Auh! This is really too evil!
What do these words mean?
You think too much!
Our honey lover of the flower of Saint Jore <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Jairo</FONT>, has been missing for a long time, Manalie is in tears every day, we really feel bad when seeing this... There are more! Verbose mother's son, granddaughter of eccentric dad, and the strange Chia aunt's nephew, they also disappeared!     And my good friend <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Arirang</FONT>... Oh! I felt a pang of discomfort when I thought of him!
Manalie's affair had been solved by me!
Oh so terrible~
Huh? I heard the thing! (Looking up and down) it is you who solves the problem.   ... Maybe, maybe you are willing to do this for me... Is about <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Arirang</FONT> and <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Isabel's</FONT> lost...
I was coming for that!
I have no time!
You must be <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>watt</FONT> the one who the old man sent here! Hmm! The old man was terribly snobbish, and never looked Arirang in his eyes. Arirang really has no money, he is only a small mechanic, but he was an honest and sincere person and was very kind.    In order to separate Isabel from Arirang, Watt even found the one who adored Isabel for many years <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>hunter Lime</FONT>, to intervene in their love! Tell me, that <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Lime</FONT> What's good? Tell me, tell me!   Arirang and Isabel disappeared at the same time, I seriously doubt, they both are <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Lime</FONT> killed by him! If they just run away, it was absolutely that Arirang would not go without any words, unless he was out of his own control... God! The more stress, the more I worry!     Please! You go and find <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Lime</FONT>, force him to tell the whereabouts of Arirang and Isabel! He is a man that is afraid of bad guys, you are so good physically, so long as you catch his fierce point, he will obediently tell the truth!
No problem!
I have told you I was not free!
As far as I know, that <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>tracking hunter Lime</FONT> recently received a commission, which is to go to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>seashells dock</FONT> to take Puffball of Chimera the Synthetic Beast; you go <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>seashells dock</FONT> there to check, he should be there waiting for pulling out the Chimeric hair!
Hou! You are really ruthless, not a human face.    good! You must remember, go, go! You must not appear in front of me again.
What! (Blue veins)    Are you new here? What is your name? Where do you live? Height and weight? Occupation? Why do you come to Saint Jore? Is there any celebrity in your hometown?
It was terrible indeed! When I think of people are missing one by one, perhaps some day I myself will be missing...    God! I'm super uncomfortable, was Saint Jore cursed?
No! Young people, you have to believe my observation, I am the radar of Saint Jore who is not nominal and will not miss any clues point!     You look unfamiliar, Are you fresh here? What is your name? where do you live? Height and weight? Occupation? why do you come to Saint Jore? Is there any celebrity in your hometown?
How? What did Qiao Zhisu say? If I know he took part in the business, I am sure he will be expelled out of St. Martin Jol!
To find the track hunter Lime at the seashells dock
Who are you? Go away! You do not scare away the prey! It is really a powerful Chimera, I was almost swallowed by it.    Hey! Didn't I tell you to dodge it? why have you blocked off ? I will not take care of you if you do not go any more!
I will let you know me!
Stay away!
Ouch! (clasping head) how can you easily beat people? I do not even know you and did not offend you, killing me...   ......... Ah? you ask me the whereabouts of Arirang and Isabel? What's up, is Isabel missing ?When did this happen, I have been here a while, and I do not know what is going on in town!   I came to here, also have seen Isabel, told her that if I get Chimeric hair, I will send her one of the most beautiful...    What... You say she is missing? Woo! Even disappeared along with Arirang?...
Don't play dumb!
You could tell me you don't know!
Ouch! (clasping head) Do not fight me any more! I really do not know! Why lie to you? I think they ran away... Woo! They once tried to run away, if it is not because of that matter...    you ask what happened? Hmm! Seven days ago, I saw Arirang and Isabel leave Saint Jore with a very big bag of belongings in the middle of the night; I am a tracking hunter! It is natural that I want to follow them.  I see them go into Amethyst Cave, where are the ghosts all around, I saw them enter into it in a short time, Isabel escorted Arirang to run out!    then I saw this and was shocked, I thought Isabel must be hurt! I asked them and I knew when he just entered the cave, he was hurt <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>by variant of werewolf</FONT> into the injury; Unfortunately, Arirang's injury is not serious, what a pity!   It is because I was stimulated by such a thing, I know that I can not have further delays, I must save money desperately, so that I could express my love directly to Isabel, thus I took over this dangerous work!     But now it is said the two of them disappeared! I really felt anxious. However, thinking about it, maybe they might get run off again. No! I want to chase them! But I have not finished the work yet!
Come on, you!
Can I help you?
I want to pull back mane to change cash, I am also worried Isabel was abducted by Arirang!     Ah ah, how to solve the problem in the end?
Seriously? Warriors, you are very kind! What great warriors, real heroes who are kind and righteous, filled with blood, very courageous, with chivalrous spirit, helpful, saving untold miseries!     That <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Warcraft Chimeric</FONT> is <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>living in Mirror on ice</FONT> area, I am not sophisticated, cannot beat it down, even cannot touch a mane So, I leave all of my hopes to you, I want to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>1 mane</FONT> like, I beg you! <) 0 (> so only pin all their hopes on you, I want to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>one mane</FONT> I beg you!
Woo! Isabel ~ Do not leave me! I love you so much, Arirang is a useless weakling, he can not give you real happiness!
Hurry up, I do not have time to take care of you, I want to desperately save money ah!
<font COLOR=#00ff00>Lime</FONT> should <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>stay at seashells dock</FONT> in the vicinity, you go there to look for him.
Oh! Isabel, Why do not you listen to his father's words? Dad did it all for you!

Oh, You are better, I played for several days, I found no way to get that monster's mane, it is to my surprise that you gained it easily, you are powerful, amazing!     Thank you! Now I will take this mane back to seek rewards of money, later, I will go to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Amethyst Cave</FONT> I judge, Isabel and Arirang are likely to re-enter the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Amethyst Cave</FONT>, they would like to leave here from there.  But Arirang is a mechanic, it is impossible that he wants to pass Amethyst Cave where are many ghosts! They may still be trapped inside.    maybe I can manage to intercept them! So how can they run out of there? You said it!
Don't go there!
You're right!
Why? How can I stand and watch my favorite person to be taken away? And she was taken away by a vulnerable one?    Moreover, are you in a hurry to find Isabel ? I am more anxious! But before I save the money, I do not want to see Isabel, you know what I am thinking of ?
Thank you for your support! Yes, I can not take your stuff without any reward, this gold is the money I buy the mane. Now I want to bring mane back! After I receive gratuities, I will be immediately rushed to the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Amethyst Cave</FONT>.    If you want to trace this matter, you can go to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Amethyst Cave</FONT> to look for me.
I need <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>a Warcraft Chimeric hair</FONT>, that monster lives in <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>the mirror ice</FONT> area, I entrust this matter to you! I would like to hear your good news quickly.
Did Lime say? He is the person who you have to force, so that he would be honest.
Oh! Isabel, Why do not you listen to father's words? Dad did this all for you.

It does not speak!
It felt too cool doing that! Forgot it!

There are deep and long cracks next to the crystal, it is likely <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>to allow medium sized people to go inside...    Huh?! It seems there is a red bow at the end of the cracks, which is <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>girl's hair accessories</FONT>... Maybe <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Isabel</FONT> is there! Go and check it out?

Thank you, Farewell - -

Return to Granikov with message concerning Isabel
Where is Isabel? You still do not find her? (Disappointed)     or is she still angry with me and does not want to come back? If so, please tell her that I guarantee I will no longer interfere with her and Arirang. As long as she is willing to come back, everything can be negotiated, Xuha!
Oh! I say the truth now!
I do not know anything!
No! I do not believe, I do not believe Isabel is dead! You lied to me, right?Tell me, rascal! My Isabel is not dead.    hell is that Arirang! Yes, I hate that presumptuous boy, I hope that he disappeared from the world. I'd rather lay contract with magic bone Wicked King, and would rather do harm to many innocent people, as long as Arirang turns into a monster, I believe Isabel will leave him!     You tell me, Arirang, after being scratched by a werewolf variant, has he become a ghost? He became an ugly horrible monster, Isabel will not fall in love with him, right... To this end, even at the expense of other people, I do not care...  But... What will come of this?Hum hum... I killed so many people just because I wanted Isabel to come back to me, but now...    Isabel-----
Take care of yourself...

Isabel, a good baby sleeps quickly, the sun sets, and the birds go home, the stars are smiling ~ sleep, my good baby, sleep ~ ~     hum hum... Why are things like that?

To visit Ross Carreras' home
Ss- - ah ssss- -my teeth are itching... Woo! If the other teeth grow out then everything will be over, I will not be saved...   (Surprised) Who are you? Why did you sneak into my house?
I heard what you said
I am just passing by
You, what did you hear... Wow haha, I'm just playing roleplaying, I am playing a human who was just bitten by a vampire, ah ha ha ha ha... Hiss hiss - - - -    Oh, I feel terrible... Ah ah ah ah Oh... - - ~ my teeth are growing out!
Be an honest man !
Then I wil go now!
What did you say? I have always been very honest! However, as a vampire expert, I can't let others know that I was bitten by a vampire... If this gets out, it will be bad! Oh no, did I say it out loud?  Hiss hiss - -    Ah! All right! I'll tell you the truth!  Yes, , I really was bitten by a vampire,  I have studied vampires for more than a decade... But I have not made a breakthrough, so I, I... I asked Watts, hoping that he can give me a vampire, so that I can finally unlock their secrets.   Watts has promised, and really helped me fetch a vampire. I have been very careful, I not only use the silver cage to shut them in, but also put garlic, holy water and a cross all around it...   To my surprise, one night, it did break through the cage, I had no time to escape, and was bitten by it. Fortunately, it was in the then early morning, otherwise I could not have survived up to now... But even so, I know there is no happy ending for me, and I will gradually be contaminated, assimilated, and finally join their kind...   Hummm, I do not want to be like that!
Sorry! I have to leave now~
Well! How can I help you?
Hey ~ Do not be so heartless! I told you the truth, don't leave~~~
Sob! I heard <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>in the Ghosts Cult</FONT> there are many capable people, and they often deal with ghosts; there is a person who is called <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Sengen</FONT>, I heard he is very good, you should look for him to help you! Thank you!
Oh uh hiss hiss - - - - if you have ntohing else then leave quickly !
Oh uh hiss hiss - - - - if you have ntohing else then leave quickly !
Ah ~ do you know what Ross Carreras is doing?   Is it the same as what I said ?  Well ~ if that is the case, the matter must be resolved quickly, I do not want the whole city of Saint Jole to turn into a city of vampires.
To look for Gem to find out vampires' legends.
Friends, we meet again! Do you have another friend hurt this time! Heh~
Yes! Here's what happened
No!
This issue can be tricky! Vampires are a range of strange races that combines human, demons, and ghosts; they never die, with power that ordinary people can't match. They have a long history, like humans, and have a complete family structure. The strength of each generation of vampires is different, so treatments are also different.   If your friend was bitten by a elder vampire, he cannot be cured; but no matter what generation of vampires, they will eventually settle in their home base, which is located at the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Vampire Castle</FONT> at the top of the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Vampire Castle</FONT>!    But the ghosts living in it are too fierce! It would be very dangerous for you to go there like this, you'd better think about it carefully. You must know that your opponent is not a typical ghost, but the family of blood which is the most terrifying among all devils. Unless your friend is worth that much to you, I would advise you to forget it!
I must save him!
Don't want to go !
Oh! You are an enthusiastic and loyal boy, you know it is such a dangerous mission, yet your are still willing to stand up for your friends, very good! I really appreciate it. Therefore, I will show you a clear way, so that you will able to achieve the task.   You know south of Saint Yore has a spiritland called <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Amethyst Cave</FONT> right! The area is filled with ores that contains mysterious treatment properties. Maybe it will have some healing property to your friend's poison.   I remember <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Healing Stone</FONT> is produced in the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Amethyst Cave (South)</FONT> area, you have to devote some energy to look for it. It is said that inside te cave, there is a <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>mysterious knight</FONT>, that knows the Amethyst Cave very well, I believe he should know something about the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Healing Stone</FONT>, you can ask him.
I will go right now!
I suddenly remembered I still have something to do.
Young man, I admire you, although you are very young, you are also very brave, it is really rare; so take these with you, I hope they can do be helpful to you.   If you chicken out, it will be alright too, the heart that you have is more than anything else! I wish you success, and please take care of yourself, I believe with your strength, it is not entirely impossible to defeat theose vampires.
Thank you!
Keep the gift.
Good luck! If you have any trouble, please come back and look for me.
Wow! Yur backpack is already full, please clear up some space
Well! This is a token of my thought. Please don't refuse it
Wow! Yur backpack is already full, please clear up some space
Well! Let's forget it! If you still want to help your friend, come to look for me again!
Ah! Vampires are not ordinary ghosts, they have terrifying magic, and they have a strong family bond to back them up; unless it is necessary, don't get too close to them!
That's good! Last time, I spent a great deal of time on Jairo    Some ghosts are really tough! It is quite worrisome,. But not all ghosts are like that, you must not stereotype them.
Hiss hiss - - I feel terrible! Please help me! hiss hiss - -     when I met you for the first time, I requested for your help, I feel really absurd but I am sure you are a kind hearted man, please! Please help me and ask that man <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Gem</FONT>!
Well ~ what's up?     If you cannot solve this problem, please tell me straightforward, so that I can immediately dispatch someone else to handle the issue concerning Ross Carreras.
Mysterious knight
<font COLOR=#00ff00>South Amethyst Cave</FONT>, there is a kind of magical curative treatment called <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Holy Stone</FONT> ; but in Amethyst Cave, ghosts are running wild, so if you want to obtain the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Saint-treatment Stone</FONT>, it won't be easy. But I heard in the Amethyst Cave, there is a mysterious knight who is low-key, but has amzing fighting prowess. If you ask him to help, perhaps you can obtain the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Holy Stone</FONT> and temporarily help Ross Carreras stop the vampire virus' invasion!
EXP x 80000, GP x 700
To ask mysterious knight to find the whereabouts of the holy stone
Amethyst Cave has collected a lot of aura, but has numerous ghosts, but it is still a good quiet location. Although ghosts are monstrous, but at least they are still easier to get along with than human... Oh, why am I tell you this!    What I want to say is that in this crystal maze, the energy are all around it, and the magical <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Treatmentstone</font>, hidden in <FONT COLOR= # 00ff00>southwest</FONT> of the cave, inside the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Medical King Crystal</FONT>. Next to the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Medical King Crystal</FONT> lives many very large and strong groups of monsters. I am afraid you have to think of a good way to access the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Medicine King Crystal</FONT>. Vampires are not common monsters, if you just use <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Holy Stone</FONT>, you won't be able to combat their poison, but it could temporarily stop the magic drug's diffusion.   So obtain the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>holy stone</FONT>for now, and help your friend temporarily, while  we find other ways to help treat him.
Forget it!
Where should I go?
Is that so? Then forget it. Sorry! I'm used to being alone. If there is nothing else, the exit is over there, feel free to leave.

If I remember correctly, this <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Healing Stone</FONT> is produced in <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>the southwest corner of South Amethyst Cave</FONT>, you have to pay attention to look for it.

Van Hells is such a despicable and nasty person, if we show him mercy, is to be cruel to mankind.  I believe you should know how to do!
Reward the mysterious knight after Giant Scythe Death was defeated.
Kill quest target: Death
Van Hells is such a despicable and nasty person, if we show him mercy, is to be cruel to mankind.  I believe you should know how to do!
Thank you for defeating Giant Scythe Death, I used the shield body transfer technique at the moment you defeated it. Let Batabi out of the belly of Giant Scythe Death... Fortunately, he has not yet been digested, but he has suffered enough.  I have sent him to a safe place, so he will not see what is about to happen; in the future, if you meet him again, do not tell him about me, or he will not let you go. You can go ahead now! But before I die, I want to know, how did you see through my identity?
The Ghost party said so
You care too much!
Ghost party?... It can't be her,, can it be... <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Gem</FONT> ? He had never wanted to let me go... I forget, I ordered the case, can not blame anyone. However, I must remind you, look out <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Gem</FONT> this guy, he is very calculating, scheming, though he looks kind, but his heart is that of a serpent...   You have to watch him, or else you will get the same result... This is all I can say, you can start now!
Lay down the law!
I will show you!
What I want to say is what you've heard, I won't make any excuses for that! Since I am going to die, I have no need for any of these possesions, you can have them all !    What's wrong? Look at you, you looks a little hesitant... let me tell you something, I do not fear death, but I do not want villains to succeed. I only hope that you can distinguish between good people and bad, do not be confused by what is in front of your eyes. If you have a trace of doubt, find <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Gem</FONT> and make things clear; As for me, I will stay here, waiting for you to come back to kill me !    Do not worry I will not run away, which is the promise I have made with the honor of a man!
I want to see you again~
I will go ask now
Go ahead ~ if you want to kill me, you can start immediately.   Moreover, these stuffs are useless to me, so take it!
Since I am going to die, you can take these worldly possessions!    But have too much stuff, so you should clean up !
Take your time ~ I hope your eyes are sharp enough!    And, these things are useless to me, so take it!
Since I am going to die, you can take these worldly possessions!    But have too much stuff, so you should clean up !
... No, You are not powerful enough, you can not kill me with your soft fist!
No! I just want to know, tell me!
Here, please call me the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>mysterious knight</FONT>, Do not call me by my original name, I do not want anyone to know my true identity.>    Do not worry, I will not escape, I just want to know Batabi is safe. <font COLOR=#00ff00>Giant Scythe Death</FONT> <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>inhabits deep in the Amethyst Cave</FONT>, it's black magic is very powerful, it can make you crazy, so you must be cautious.

The return of Van Hells
Van Hells was hurt by the Silver Cross, and seems to have lost his senses, so that his idea was  controlled by demon. He is <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>at the top of the Holy Hill</FONT>, trying to summon the demon world's militant devils <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>True Abadon</FONT>, in an attempts to attack Saint Yore ! This would not work, we must quickly stop it.

If someone does not kill Van Hells, I'm afraid there will be a second BoA. You make quickly <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>go back</FONT> and find <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Van Hells</FONT>, you must destroy him this time, do not let him continue to threaten the world.  Oh!

Now I can only entrusted everything to you, please be sure you will defeat him this time! Otherwise we will once again be facing a human catastrophe.
Return to Gem after beating True Abadon
Kill quest target: True Abadon
Nice! Fortunately, you beat the Evil Dark Angel called out by Van Hells: <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>True - Abadon</FONT>, to prevent it from violating the human world, this is a great service! <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Apache Shield</FONT> is the Devil and one of the most horrible devil, a very good thing you have done!   He sees no peaceful reunification and only knows aggression, war and death. I did not think that you would be able to overthrow it, it seems you are closer to the Holy One now ! I am extremely pleased that I can meet you. If not for you, not only my life, but humanity is likely to perish. The world would be out of balance; Ghosts party will never want to let this happen, and the one at fault is <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Van Hells</FONT>.   I told you he was not good, but you let him go because of your soft-heart, so that led to the crisis. Fortunately you are not too late, better late than never, humanity is finally able to escape the devastating consequences, in order to reward you, you should accept this little gift !
No!
Thank you~
If you do not accept, I will not continue to deliver important tasks for you...
Good, that's why I admire you... In fact, Van Hells has just came by......... (Hesitantly)    Forget it, I think you should be tired, go take a rest now! (Worried)
The rumor is that at the top of Saint Hill, a big upheaval occurred, Van Hells even call the Devil who is one of the most horrible devil dark angel <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>True - Abadon</FONT>, to break into the human world by force!    I have fought with this <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Abadon</FONT> before, who is too strong to be defeated so easily! He knows no peaceful reunification, only aggression, war and death. I did not expect such a big disaster come to us, what are we going to do?
I want to destroy everything, I want to burn the Earth and Hell!    BoA, is that not what you want? Ha ha ha ha ha!
<font COLOR=#00ff00>The host was not home, no entry!</FONT>
Van Hells... Woo...
Turbulent Saint Yore
When I came back to the covenant, I found out from Gem that Van Hells had came back to fight us, and many <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Knights</FONT> were hurt! To go and find <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>St. Stamen Cathedral</FONT> to snoop news, knowing that Van Hells went back to the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>notorious vampire castle</FONT>! It seems this is God's will, to challenges human by fighting the vampires for hundreds of years!
EXP x 10000, GP x1200 big bottle red water x3
Go to St. Stamen Cathedral to visit the knights
Van Hells... You dare to do such a thing... I, I...
I would help you
How can you help me?
I, I...(faints)
Go to the castle...To look for Bata...Batabi...Van Hells... Blood of Van Hells...
I will go immediately!
It is too far to go!
...Van Hells...Mo...(faint)
...(Faint)...
Oh, oh...Painful... I feel sad... He actually dares to hurt me...sob! (faints)
I do not believe that Van Hells would do this to me! Many years ago we even had to fought side by side... bang! (fell to the ground)
You first go to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>St. Stamen Cathedral</FONT> to visit the injured, perhaps from them, we can find out some useful information!
To the vampire castle to find Mo Fanbe.
You, why do you come here?
Last Battle with Van Hells!
Trembling~
Huh? Do not, do not be angry! Van Hells is not like what you think, actually, he, in fact... in fact he returned to the top of <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Saints Hill</FONT>! But he did not return to the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Eagle nest</FONT>, the exact whereabouts of him I... I do not know.  But he rampaged thru Saint Yore, I think the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Knights team</FONT> at <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Sacred Hilltop</FONT> should have gotten the news, you can go there to find the contact <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Mariana</FONT> to ask, maybe... Uh... He will know the whereabouts of Van Hells. About that... I am afraid you will be tired on the trip, so this is my little piece of offering, please accept it. Heh ~
Thank you very much!
No, not at all!
Goodbye, goodbye~
Wu~ you ran out of space!
Yes, please take it!   Bye bye~
Yes, I want it, please take it!    Wu~ you have no room!
However, it is dangerous here, you'd better go elsewhere!
...Van Hells...Mo...(faints)
Oh, oh...painful... I feel sad... He actually dares to hurt me...sob! (faints)
Oh oh..the pain is too much to bear...(faints)
This time, you must be careful of a guy called <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Batabi</FONT>    As far as I know, <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Mo Fanbe</FONT> is a good friend of Van Hells, he will be partial to Van Hells, so don't be swindled by him!
Return of Cat's Bell
Paladin and St. Maribela took the risk to go into the vampire castle; But they were unexpectedly trapped by the cat girls' charm spell. It seems that you have to help St. Maribela to come to her senses before finding Van Hells!

Is this the Cat's Bell? Thank you so much! I'll break the bell right away to see if Maribela's soul is in there. My Friend! This is a gift of gratitude I will give you on Maribela's behalf. Thank you so much for everything you've done for us friends. Come to see me if you have any questions. I'll tell you everything that I know.  But I do have one more request. Maribela's personal action has violated the military rules. Though I know it is not right to ask you to do so, I still hope that you can keep this a secret for her, and never let it be known by her superior. Many thanks!

Thank you so much for everything you've done for us friends. Come to see me if you have any questions. I'll tell you everything that I know.
I know there are several kinds of evil cat girls. But I'm sorry, I can't figure out what kind of cat girls hurt Maribela.  But Maribela is very powerful, and no cat girls can do her any harm except the most powerful one: <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Cerberus</FONT>! You may take the chance to find her and perhaps you can get the tool that is trapping Maribela's soul <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Cat's Bell</FONT>.
Oh~I don't know where Van Hells is. Don't ask me.  Go ask the Goddess or St. Maribela who defends the Sacred Hilltop...
....Ehh......Ummmm......
Entering castle
Accept St. Maribela's commission, go to the vampire castle to find Van Hells and meet Batabi at entrance to castle; In order to prevent the valiant form causing Van Hells any trouble, he offers a deal--defeat <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Dracula</FONT> rescue the poisoned vampire expert <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Ross Carreras</FONT>.

You...You come again? The guy who wants to find Van Hells... has gone to the Goddess! Or St. Maribela, the little girl by her side will also know it!
I will find him now!
Monk never lies!
Um, good bye!
What! Er......Benefactor, please don't hurt Van Hells. He has his own difficulties and pains. He is absolutely not the one as you have imagined. Please don't fight him... All right! Let me make a deal with you. I know the vampire expert Ross Carreras was infected with the demonic poison of vampire and may be changed any time. If you promise me not to fight Van Hells, I will tell you how save him!
...Ok!
Refused!
Listen, the vampire caught by Ross Carreras for research is actually <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Count Dracula's</FONT> lineal son and heir. You must have heard of <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Dracula</FONT>! He is a pure-blood vampire who has lived for hundreds of years and possesses awesome power and magic. So if you want to save Ross Carreras, you have to defeat <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Count Dracula</FONT>, get his blood and make <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>serum</FONT>, This is the only way to save Ross Carreras! <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Count Dracula</FONT> is on the castle's <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>first floor</FONT>, only when you kill him, can I get his blood and make serum to save people!
If you don't agree to my request, I will not go anywhere and you have to kill me before you can pass! I...Hallo Hallo! I am not kidding. Don't hurt Van Hells!   Priest is begging you! If you refuse my request, Biwen Feili will not love you!
Be safe! Sorry we can not help you!
Please help Van Hells! Please!

Please help Van Helsing! Please!
Be safe! Sorry we can not help you!
Do you have any good news for me?  Oh! You mean in this bottle is something that can save my life. Is that <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Dracula's Blood Serum</FONT> ?It must be Gem who asked you to bring it to me! I really appreciate his help! And I will remember this in my heart!  Haw-haw! I am so lucky, compared with people in Maximilian. They are so stupid! They even hate Gem and refuse to help him! I don't care whether they will die or not. It is none of my business after all. But the knights seem to be very concerned. Anyway, I can understand. When old friends turned enemies all of a sudden it is natural that they are all in panic...  Oh, <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>give Dracula's Blood Serum</FONT> to me quickly, three times a day, and use it up!
Unwilling to give!
Give it to me! You even have time to trouble me. I'd rather you took a look at those <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>knights</FONT> guys! I found their symptoms are similar to mine and even worse. But they were attacked by Van Hells and they are not supposed to be the same as me!    Does it suggest that Van Hells is actually a vam...Ok, Ok! I stop. Then, you take the trouble to bring me the serum, let me give you something in return. Take this !
I can finally see my rescuer! By the way, if you have time, oh and have a look at those <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>knights</FONT> guys! Their symptoms are similar to mine and even worse. But they are attacked by Van Hells, it is not reasonable to treat me like that!   Could it be possible to say that actually van Hells is a vampire...Ok ok la! It's just ok that I shut my mouth. Then~you help me with legwork, you have pains even if you are void! Take it with you!
How is it going? Did you ask Gem about how to completely get rid of the demonic poison in my body.  On no account will I die with such a disgrace or even turn into a vampire!
Van Hells is very horrible. Batabi has been enthralled by him and is very faithful to him. You must know the truth and never get confused by them!
Sincere friend
Friends who were hurt by Van Hells are starting to speak in their sleep. But there isn't enough serum to save all of them. Dracula is already dead...What shall be done? It looks like turning to Gem for help is the only way out!
Paladin Goddess and St. Maribela took risks going into the vampire castle; But they were unexpectedly trapped by cat girls' enthrallment spell. It seems that you have to help St. Maribela come to her senses before finding Van Hells!

Go to find Gem for solution
You do not speak, I know! The gang of Maximilian, from the beginning, follow Van Hells, treat him as their own leaders, they are hostile to the enemy of Van Hells ! Unfortunately, I am one of them.   I can only say, Van Hells is good at confusing people. No way! He is the son of Cain! Dracula can tempt so many girls, so that they willingly give their blood to him; as the blood of the ancestor's son, Van Hells' abilities is more powerful.   So, the serum of Dracula has been useless, only <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>kill Van Hells</FONT>, and use <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>his blood</FONT>, can save the gang of Maximilian! At the moment I heard Van Hells stayed in <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Vampire Castle</FONT>, you should know how to do it?
It is the only way to do it!
No, I do not want.
Good! I know you have been tracking his whereabouts, so I believe that you will be able to fulfill this task.   Go! Kill Van Hells, and bring back his blood !
Why? You are afraid of him? You do not hurt him before?    In fact, he is not invincible and also have weaknesses! Moreover, he's now injured, now, it is a good opportunity to eliminate him, and I hope you'll consider it.
I have told you how to save people, you can not come to trouble Van Hells any more.

You are not the leader! Or you will take other people to come?   Call everyone to come here ! It is a piece of cake for me to do with you!
If you do not want to be beat, do not come back again!
Hey! What? You do then?(Warning)    I've already told you the method to save people, why do you come to trouble Van Hells again?
I just drop by.
He had hurt many people!
Is it? Then you can leave! It is very dangerous. If not to stare at you, I'm not around here.
What! Van Hells... Why did he do this? Stupid, stupid! Fool!    ... So you come to kill him?
Yes, your answer is right!
I told you I just passed by!
What? You. It seems that I had resorted to the ultimate nirvana:    Ha! <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>dim goddess illusion - -</FONT>

You must go to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Vampire Castle</FONT> to kill Van Hells, and brought back his blood, otherwise, Maximilian can not be saved!
Speak to Batabi after you are saved
Woo! This is my own idea, and does not concern to Van Helsing, you can kill me! Van Helsing is hurting, you are so strong, he will be killed by you!    Unless... Unless he selects again <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>fall</FONT>...
I mean no harm but to help.
Well, I give up!
I know Van Hells put it too far. After all, they have been friends and gone through thick and thin together...Okay! I can put you in, but you have to allow me to apply a curse on you.  This spell won't hurt you, but it will protect the blessed man. Unless you agree, I won't let you know of his whereabouts!
I agree. Come on!
I am not threatened.
Loving Goddess Cloudy Beauty~, Please bless the man in front of me! May he and my friend Van Hells share your blessing. Mo suo li kef a ai zhong. Ding ding.Sa!   Okay! You can go in now. Van Hells is <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>staying in a room on the second floor.</font>, At the door is <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>a Blood cross just like the one of his family.</font>, You can enter following the instructions.

Wu ~ you have no more place!
Take it! Don't make me worry about you.
Take it! Don't make me worry about you.  Wu ~ you have no more place!
All right. Whatever you say. I don't believe you can find Van Hells without following my advice.
Whoa! Why is It so sudden... I have breathed a sigh of relief but also felt a strong sense of emptiness...  Thank you anyway!
You must go to kill Van Hells, and brought back his blood, otherwise, Maximilian can not be saved!

Great! How happy I am to see you two are safe and sound! (cry) Van Hells was defeated again by you, so he is a little frustrated! Haha! I really appreciate your showing mercy to him.  Actually, Van Hells is silly. He hates his half-human, half-demon bloodline. At the same time, he used to be so naive as to believe that he could suppress the fairyhood inside him. However, the archfiend never spared him, and he even forced him to swear allegiance to the devildom by despicable means.  Since Van Hells has never meant to harm humans, he has lived incognito on the top of the great Saints all these years. Only at his leisure does he come out to wipe out the bullies and help the down-trodden in the quality of a chivalrous man. He expected to enjoy a quiet life in this way. It never occurred to him that you would appear and destroy his quiet life, forcing the painful memories into his mind...   He is very frustrated, and never want to hide any longer! As well be hanged for a sheep as for a lamb, that is why he intentionally raided Saint Yore so that you have the reason to kill him. Actually Van Hells had no intention to harm the others, because as long as he dies, the virus inside Saint Laurent and the others will blow itself out.   He had asked me to tell you about this after you have killed him. However, his life was spared. If you want to save lives, we cannot but to use his blood. Go get him! Hurry up!
OK !
I am too lazy to.
I really appreciate your making the effort. He was so silly and wanted to die! Please, you must accept the gift.
You are welcome!
Okay, I should do it.
You must accept it! Come on! If you refuse, I will get crazy.  And I would like you to pay a visit to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Van Hells on behalf of me.</font> Don't feel embarrassed!
Please accept the gift! It is a great honor.  Remember to call on <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Van Hells for me.</font> The guy must be very frustrated at the moment! Ah ha ha ha!
Um! You are really lazy. Could you be more industrious? A lazy man cannot save the world.
You must go to kill Van Hells, and bring back his blood, otherwise Maximilian can not be saved!
Uh... Hiss... Hiss... Hiss hiss......
Hiss Hiss Hiss Hiss Hiss Hiss Hiss Hiss Hiss Hiss Hiss Hiss Hiss Hiss Hiss Hiss Hiss Hiss Hiss Hiss Hiss Hiss--
Gem has long hated Van Hells...Be careful! Don't be the cat's paws...Ah his ah his--

The Son of Demon
Van Hells has finally recovered! The thrashing was too hard on him, yet it contributed to rescuing him. I feel worried about him, though. When I learned from Batabi that Van Hells, badly wounded as he was, pretends <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>a mysterious chivalrous man</FONT> and is hanging around <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>the Amethyst Cave</FONT>, I rushed to pay him a visit, in the hope of comforting him. What's more, I encouraged him to shake himself together and join us in the fight against the demons!
EXP x 30000, GP x 500
Go to the Amethyst Cave to get the blood of the mysterious chivalrous man.
There you are...En-hem! Your last thrashing laid so heavy on me that I can hardly recover my breath... Why didn't you thrash even harder? That way I don't have to suffer the pain at least!
Sorry lah!
Alive, there is hope
You didn't do anything wrong. It is I who am wrong. Alas...
Hah! Half-demon and half-human, big as the world is, I have nowhere to go. I have always held onto a dream of driving away demons of all kinds so that humans can return to the beautiful world blessed by Goddess Cloudy Beauty. However, anytime I am exorcising the demons, an inexplicable sense of pity possesses me.   I don't know why I have such a sense of compassion. However, as long as I find any demons, I spare none of those who have committed heinous crimes and murdered countless lives. However, the moment I kill them, sense of guilt arise in me.   Not until several years ago, when I entered the demon world alone to challenge the grisliest Vampire clan in the devildom and encountered Sara the Vampire Beelzebub, did I learn about my true origin. I should be the son of Sara the Vampire Beelzebub and a fallen human being. I have to believe this fact!   But Sara says, as his blood runs in my body, sooner or later I will abandon the will of a human being. And in time, the demon blood inside me will awaken, which will let me lose human nature and become a real son of devil!
Don't give up!
Have you ever given up?
(with a wry smile) I had thought I would never give up, and that he was just fooling me before I met <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Baor</FONT>...She is a very kind and beautiful girl, the only one I loved in my life.   In order to be with her, I would like to give up the world to spend the rest of my life with her... Never had I thought...She should be... <font COLOR=#00ff00>the daughter of devildom!</FONT>, She used me by making me believe that she had been killed by a human being! I was crazy! I lost head and at last released blood of the fairyhood.   Once the devil seal was broken, it was impossible for me to come back. Now I am unable to restore the pure humanity. For fear of losing control of myself, I have lived incognito remote from the world ever since, hoping to live a quiet life, yet you came with the deadly weapons.  You do not need to blush with shame, because I know you were used by the evildoer! Gem is but a mean villain. He has admired Baor for a long time. It is for Baor that he wouldn't let me off! You must be careful because the Church of Ghosts is not a respectable organization. They take advantage of human kindness to infiltrate and sabotage the human society.   This event was also stirred up by them! It is a shame that I should be trapped by their scheme, losing control once again and injuring my former companion... To think of that makes me feel ashamed to face them.   In this jar is my blood, which may detoxify the evil venom in the body. Please quickly take it back to rescue Saint Lord and Hathew! As for Ja Anby, please tell her that I died and ask her to forget all about me! Unlucky with few blessings, I am doomed not to be able to obtain happiness all my life.
Good!
No !
Good bye!
Take my blood back!   ...But there is no room on you. Please make some room for the jar!
Please help me! I am really too ashamed to go back and face them.
Had I not given up, how could I have become so degenerate? Alas!
The guy Van Hells was wounded; however he isn't staying to rest in the Eagle's Nest but has gone to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Amethyst Cave instead</FONT>. Alas!!! He is really a stubborn fellow!   Go get him !
Returned to Saint Yore with the blood of Van Hells to rescue Saint Eminence and others.

That is the right thing!
How is Van Hells? Hiss Hiss...  Though I am a knight of Hierophant, I respect him deeply. Believe in me...Hiss Hiss! He is anything but a villain!
Wuhm wuhm...Hiss Hiss-- Leave me alone! Let me die and get down with it. Since Van Hells want me to die, I will have his wish fulfilled!
Hiss hiss...I am so upset. Van Hells should treat me that way... Doesn't he understand my heart... Hiss hiss--
Who are you? Leave me alone! Hiss Hiss--Don't touch me!   Stay away from me! Even the former brothers in arms should hurt us, so I won't believe any stranger!
Hiss Hiss--Ahwo...My teeth are so itchy...Hiss Hiss Hiss Hiss Hiss Hiss Hiss Hiss Hiss Hiss Hiss Hiss Hiss--
You've lost the blood of mine? Ahaha! It doesn't matter. I have got plenty!   Here you are. In the jar is the blood of mine. It can detoxify the evil venom in their body. Hurry up! Take it back to rescue Saint Eminence, Hathew and all the others! As for Ja Anby... Just tell her to forget me!

Please take the blood in the jar back and give it to Saint Eminence and the others! Thank you!   Besides...Please tell Ja Anby to forget all about me. I am doomed to be a lonely man. Tell her not to bring trouble upon herself... Nothing will happen between us.

While taking leave of Van Hells, I was asked to take a message to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Ja Anby</FONT>, Who could have expected that <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Ja Anby</FONT> should break down like this! I learned from her that Van Hells won't be able to shake off the unfortunate curse unless he kills <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Sara the Vampire Beelzebub</FONT> ; But <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Sara</FONT> is simply too powerful. No one can kill him unless he...

EXP x 270000, GP x 2700
Enter the Fortress and overthrow Sara to payback Batabi
Kill quest target: The Vampire Beelzebub %d / %d
Ha...Aha ha, I know that you can manage it. You are really something! You were able to overthrow the Vampire Beelzebub! It has been unthinkable for us!   Thanks to your bravery, we humans were saved at last! I believe you are definitely qualified to aspire after the chair for one of the Four Heroes! But you must take great care, because the news that you've overthrown Sara has reached every corner of both man's world and the devildom. Now man regards you as a hero, while the forces in the devildom regard you as a thorn in the flesh. Therefore, you must pay special attention to your own safety. We cannot go without you.  San Joel has already received the news! The leaders on both sides are to praise you, so am I, of course, although I am only a friar, who doesn't have the prominent identity. However, my blessings and thanks to you are no less than others!
This is what I should do.
I agree!
Ha! I like the way you never put on airs! Now that you have overthrown Sara, Van Hells no longer has to be controlled!   He is now at <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Amethyst Cave</FONT>, so he may not have received the news. If you can afford the time, please go there to tell him the good news!  Abhorrent as Cain is, he is evermore his father. He may be very sad to hear the new! He needs comfort, so anyway you must be entrusted with the task. Come on!

Sara is on the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>third floor of the Fortress</FONT>! Make sure you prevent him before he can call in his vampire army. Otherwise flames of war will be ignited not only in San Joel, but all over the world...
Gem's trick
After overthrowing nasty Sara, get to Amethyst Cave to find the mysterious chivalrous man Van Hells and tell him about the news. After that, return to Saint Yore to find Gem. Seeing that his deception was exposed, Gem used his cutthroat癒XIllusion. Not until the player has defeated Gem can he get the truth out of his mouth!
EXP x 280000, GP x 2800
Talk with Gem and disclose his deception.
(a little panic) Ah! You've come back. I hear you've downthrown Sara, the most powerful king of the vampire family. You are so powerful and so amazing! We humans are all proud of you!    However, you spared the life of that degenerate Van Hells, but why? Now that you've downthrown his father, Van Hells is sure to take his revenge on you. Therefore, you must draw the first blood!
I have seen through your deception!
That is also!
What nonsense are you talking! Have you been brainwashed by Van Hells? Our church have always committed ourselves to peace, hoping that humans can turn hostility into friendship with devildom. As a result, sometimes we inevitably stay close to the devils.   Then I assure you that we absolutely stand neutrally between two sides. Never think that the Church of Ghosts is evil cult simply because of this.  Moreover, Van Hells is indeed the son of Demon. However normal he looks at other times, the fairyhood inside him will lose control in case of any stimulus. He even killed the good and simple young girl Baor.  how can you believe such ruthless murderer?
I've seen through your deception!
Why? I am confused by you!
So you've know everything. Huh! That being the case, I do not have to pretend. Yes, we Church of Ghosts is an organization by the devildom, which is intended to penetrate the human society and deceive the ignorant humans into serving us!    Van Hells is nothing but one of the chessmen in a game! In order to take advantage of him, we have made great sacrifices. The young girl <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Baor</FONT>, who made Van Hells so sad and emotional, is no other than the then hierarch of Church of Ghosts, <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Devil of Enchantment</FONT>!   She pretended to be an ordinary human young girl and tempted Van Hells. When she found that Van Hells had fallen in love with her, once more, she pretended to be killed by the human race in order to arouse a murderous impulse in Van Hells against the human being and to awaken the secret fairyhood inside him.    Huh! Never did I realize that Van Hells could have so strong a will. After learning about the truth, he should be able to reduce the awakening fairyhood out of our control. It does not matter, however. The more he wanted to escape, the more he is carried beyond himself!   Our biggest aim is to deceive the fools like you into working for us. And you have smoothly helped us to find Van Helsing after so many years' hiding!     Many thanks! Haha! That Van Helsing, I'll deal with him. But for him, our former hierarch <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Devil of Enchantment</FONT> wouldn't have been abolished <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>as a result of mission failure.</font>! As for you, because you know too much, I can not leave you alone. You will die!
No!
Come on!
Ha! As you are not man enough to accept my challenge, you got out of way! You useless tit! Hahaha!
Ha! How dare you! Such a callow fellow as you should dare to challenge me, the first throne of Onmyoji in Church of Ghosts. However, since you have helped me find the trace of Van Hells, I'll give you some time to brief your last words.   Come to me after you have written your suicide note!
You are so muddled as to be confused by him. You really made me upset! However, as a bridge between the two circles, I have been well-prepared to accept the blame. Alas! As the saying goes, If I am not willing to go to hell, Nobody will.
Go and wipe out Van Hells before his wounds are healed. You must hurry, and any delay will lead to endless troubles.
How to deal with <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>gem</FONT> will entrust to you!
How? Have you seen Van Hells? You should comfort him nicely. As for the dirty dog, Gem, hum, I will get even with him one day!
Now, fight to the finish with Gem and take out his soul.
Obtain Task Item: Soul of Saint Gem %d / %d
Hurry up, take my soul back to me! My aura...Without my soul, I began to exaggerate the aura...Take my soul back to me...
No~
Give me a reason that let you have it back!
Van Hells will not last much longer if you don't give me back, Do you think that Sara's death and Van Hells was saved?    Ha Ha Ha Ha! Actually that will only let him die faster!
If I died, Van Hells cannot live either. To kill Sara will not save Van Hells. In stead, it will lead him to the death road!    If you promised to take my soul back, I can give all my belongings to you and tell you the method how to save Van Hells!!
Just tell me the method first!
Hum~i just don't agree with it!
You human beings think so long as gem dies, Van Hell-Sing will disentangle? Hah, you are completely wrong! In fact if Sara is alive, it can check and balance the Trinity Blood inside Van Hell-Sing by TRB power.   Now since Sara is dead, Trinity Blood of Van Hell-Sing has not been controlled any more, and it breaks out completely! However, Van Hells absolutely wants to oppress the strong power of we Nightmare with his weak human being's will. But he will never succeed. In stead, Trinity Blood will bite back him, and makes him crazy!     may be currently only <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Resurrected Ruby</FONT> can help his. They say <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Resurrected Ruby</FONT> is so made by congealation of the last breath of byfl's dissipation. This is just myth and legend. Nobody knows <FONT COLOR=#00ff00></FONT> whether Resurrected Ruby is existing in this world. Hence, Van Hells has no way but wait to die. Haw-haw! Well, now you can return spirit to me!
Actually you do not deserve the soul!
Here you are!
Hum! Now that you are so frank, I will remind you, go to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Amethyst Cave</FONT> to visit Van Hells quickly! I think now he can feel the agony of the death of Sara...Ah, ahahah...  As for the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>whereabouts of</FONT> Resurrected Ruby? Hm! Consult with <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>those Royal Knight</FONT> in Sacred Hilltop <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>! Any way, they know well about local mythos. You can try to go to ask them, you may be able to find it! Haw-haw...
Hum! Now that you are so frank, I will remind you, go to visit Van Hells quickly! I think now he can feel the agony of the death of Sara...Ah, ahahah...

Any way, they know well about local mythos. You can try to go to ask them, you may be can find! haw-haw...
Then let Van Hells bury with the dead! But you may not think death of Van Hells has nothing to do with you. He will by no means die silently. He will lose humanity and sense, the wilderness inside his body will regenerate.   Van Hells, borders on death, will be more powerful, frightful than him, the vicious. Finally he will perish together with this world. At that time, you human beings will all die! at that time, none of you human being can live!
Hum! are your ready to be killed?
Not yet!
Go ahead, make my day!
Shit! a dead dog. Vanish before me immediately if you dread of death, never coming back!    Van Hells is waiting for me to handle. I have no time to be with you!
Well~you or your accomplice is not powerful enough. Or somebody has hided, absent! Piss off ! You coward!
So you are not the head! Or you have co-workers in the black? Go fighting GUYS, together! I don't want to trouble to beat you down one by one!
How to deal with gem will entrust to you!
How? Have you seen Van Hells? You should comfort him nicely. As for the dirty dog, Gem, hum, I will get even with him one day!
Resurrected Ruby
Know from Gem, to kill Sara will not rescue Van Hells completely. On the contrary, it will make the trinity blood jitter! Rush to Amethyst Cave to have a look, the Van Hells with the pseudonym mysterious knight-errant really close to crazy. It cannot look at him helplessly! He has no way but to ask <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Maribela</FONT> for help.
EXP x 240000, GP x 2300
Go to Sacred Hilltop to ask Maribela.
Oh! hello, thank you very much for last time. If you needs help, just tell us, I and Mariana will definitely help you.   well! how about brother Van Hells? I thick of him a lot. If you know his whereabouts, please tell me? Thank you.
No!
I want to ask you something about Resurrected Ruby!
Oh, it doesn't matter, you're all the same (disappointed)
<font COLOR=#00ff00>Resurrected Ruby</FONT>? That is the perish treasure only exists in legend. Whether it exists in the world is doubtful! They say as far as you take <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Resurrected Ruby</FONT>, you can get unraveled purified nimbus, and eliminate all the vicious spirit, and purify all creatures; more over, it can make people close to death come back to life, and it even works to the newly died creatures.   it sounds really incredible! Hence I am very suspect <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>truth of existence of Resurrected Ruby</FONT> ; but I have ever a wording, it says before Cloudy Beauty scatters, she sent her last breath, that is <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Resurrected Ruby</FONT>, to the empress of devildom, <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Lilith</FONT>.   Cloudy Beauty hoped her pure nimbus, can purify <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>the dreggy heart of Lilith</FONT>, make her no longer wicked or resentment and anger; I don't know if the legend is true. But what is undeniable is, Lilith</FONT>, as the empress of devildom <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>, left the devildom by nameless reasons. Then lives by herself in Waterfall Tunnel</FONT> of the human world.   if you want to look for <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Resurrected Ruby</FONT>, just go to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Waterfall Tunnel</FONT> have a try. Maybe there is blest legendary substance in her.
I have known, thanks!
I want to think about it again!
You should be careful, the empress of devildom doest nor have unearned reputation.   one thing! Why you risk so much to challenge <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Lilith</FONT> ?maybe there is no <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Resurrected Ruby</FONT> in her body! but to verify by yourself is more effective than to guess here. I believe that the people making you adventurous must be have an important place in your heart. May you succeed, work hard! Alas! Brother Van Hells, if it were for you, I am also willing to take the risk.
Hm! <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Lilith</FONT> has left the devildom, there is demon characteristic in her, if you disturb her randomly, she will not let you go.    besides, <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Resurrected Ruby</FONT> is just a legend. To take life risk to challenge <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Lilith</FONT> for one phantom shadow, really risk too much!
Sorry! I know little bout such legend. You can ask Maribela. She reads much and know much!
If you want know <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>matters concerning Resurrected Ruby</FONT>, you can ask cert Knight</FONT>, who defends in <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>place of</FONT> Sacred Hilltop. He know best about this Ghost gadgets of such legend.
Such anguish, my body seems to crack immediately...
Surprised, suddenly feels a gust of strong uneasiness. Does anything occurs?    could Van Hells suffer some accident?

Haw...What is that in your hand? Once touch,... I felt much better for the pain in my body... Ah? You say the object in your hand is <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Resurrected Ruby</FONT>! Isn't it the fetish in fantasy?    it's so surprised that it really exists in the human world. It is really inconceivable! Just touch it hand, and the pain of the degree of fire burning disappeared completely. Is it really the breath of the goddess Cloudy Beauty?it's so magical...
Please take it!
This is just your illusion!
But have used so cherish relics for nothing. If later some people need it than I do, is it true that there is no way to rescue him!
Believe me, you are the one who needs it most!
I don't know either.
...I know you are afraid if were out of control, it may cause catastrophe to the human beings... Ok! I will take <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Resurrected Ruby</FONT>, to prevent the unexpected incidents from occurring.   you are really a brave and warm hearted guy.

Well, here you are, just regard it as the present of our first meeting.  one another thing, just now <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Batabi</FONT> came here to look for you, and it seems he was very urgent; He ask me to transfer, that if I see you, please go to castle to look for him.   ah! from when you two had so good relationship than that with me?
Let me think over. After all, this time Resurrected Ruby is significantly valuable. I don't wanna waste it...
No! Such a feeling of infiltrating to heart and spleen, comfort through all the body, really exists, and it is by no means my illusion!
Oh, ahah- My body seems to crack immediately...  oh ho ho ho-kill kill kill!
But I had told you, if you want know <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>matters concerning Resurrected Ruby</FONT>, you can ask Cert Knight</FONT>, who defends in <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>place of</FONT> Sacred Hilltop. He know best about this Ghost gadgets of such legend.
Warrior! Have you really discovered Resurrected Ruby? It's so magical, I had thought it was just the treasure only in the myth! it tells me many myths are really true!
Maribela is really a vivid book. Just to consult to her if you have any problems.
Congratulations! For you have discovered so rare magical treasure...(perhaps he was thinking)    if we have such object, I don't know if we can help brother Van Hells...
According to the legend, <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Lilith</FONT> has <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Resurrected Ruby in her body</FONT>, and she lives <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>in Waterfall Tunnel</FONT>. You can go there to ask her for it; but it is a enigma if <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Resurrected Ruby</FONT> exists in this world, you had better to balance before going there, to avoid taking risk for nothing.
Surprised, suddenly feels a gust of strong uneasiness. Does anything occurs?    could Van Hells suffer some accident?

It is simply unfair! In view of grades at school and intelligence and wisdom, I am better than Walgoskov. However, only because Walgoskov is a favorite student of Edison the Head Forger, did he easily obtain the position of the tutor of novices!    It doesn't matter that I didn't become tutor of novices! I wasn't even accepted as a graduate student at the lab section. And Dancing Willow also ignored me. Damn it!
Are you really excellent?
There should be a solution!
I hate it that even a passing rough fish like you have to say so...
Umm! I have got an idea to deal with Edison. As for Dancing Willow...I don't know what to do? I only know she often goes to the Corpse Church on missions. I hope to be of some help to her.  But I only know that if I talk to her directly, she will scoff at the attempt. So could you privately ask her <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>younger sister</FONT> whether Dancing Willow has met some difficulty. And I would like to offer help.
Then I will pay her a visit!
Gee! I can't offer the time!
Then you go quickly! I have to ask Edison about the reason why I lost! But before going there, I would like to go to Hengery's to buy some pick-me-up beverage.  Recently he sells a new drink, which makes you light and refreshed. It is a great feeling. I need the drink very much to shake off the depressed mood quickly!
A new beverage?
I also have good stuff here!
You sound like my mother! Hurry if you want to go! If you don't, stop it!
Who would like such cloying and sweetish stuff! However, to honor you, I will take it! Please do me a favor to go quickly and ask about Dancing Willow.
If you can't offer the time, forget about it! I will go to Hengery's to buy some beverage. He sells a new drink, which makes you light and good! It is a great feeling! I need to drink something to numb my feelings.

Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What shall I do? My elder sister must chew my head off! Hum! Hum! Hum!
What is wrong?
Imp, Must you be so noisy?
Whoa! I saw my elder sister has a beautiful necklace made of <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Teeth Necklace</FONT>. I took it out and played with it, but a horrible ghost grabbed it off! <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Uncle Kasha</FONT> took me to chase after him, but the ghost ran into <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>the Corpse Church</FONT>!   That Chapel is built of the bones of our defeated knights. How terrifying! Besides, there are lots of demons and monster inside. I am too scared to enter! <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Uncle Kasha</FONT> went there to get the necklace for me. I am worried about him very much. And I am even more worried that he might tell my sister the whole story when he sees her. Would you please do me a favor and take me there to find him?
I don't dare to enter.
Let me try.
Whoa! What am I supposed to do? my elder sister love that Teeth Necklace. Lately I often see her smiling with that necklace...If she comes back and finds the necklace gone, she won't let me go. I would become a little vampire after being spanked.
Hum! You must hurry! I am afraid Uncle Kasha will get injured. But I am more afraid that he would run into my elder sister!
What did you say? Leave me alone if you can't stand. Nobody asks you to come to my home and listen to me crying! Whoa! Whoa!
The beet wine is surprisingly easy to drink...However, Hengery's drink is better!   It is strange that every time I drink his beverage, I get butterflies in my stomach...I may as well go and buy some more bottles. Eh? What are you doing here at this moment? Go get <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Dancing Queen</FONT> for the latest news about Dancing Willow!
What about Justin? Is he feeling any better? I am rather concerned about him...  Eh? I don't like him! I... I just...Because...Aw! How nasty you are! I can't tell you.
Go to the Corpse Church to look for Uncle Kasha
The Monster here are really powerful! I can no longer chase any further. Hi, my friend, how are you here?
Someone told me to see you
I came here just for a tour!
This child is really close. She must be afraid I may get hurt and asked a strong young man to help me! In fact, old as am, my feat is never inferior to that of young people. At that time when I was involved in war, I roamed around the world with a pair of machetes...  However, one has to accept old age. To be frank, I am too tired to go any further! But only a little tired! I can still go forward, but I will take a rest. I am only afraid to keep Dancing Queen waiting too long. Now that you are here, I may as well give you a chance to show yourself.
Don't mention it.
What are you doing in here?
That won't do. You must! I never envies a talent and am willing to give young people opportunities. There are plenty of people who like me.
A good question! At that time Dancing Queen and other children were playing games of married couple at the entrance to Meteor Pit. Tut... Gee... The children are really cute! But suddenly, a group of horrible demons monster never seen before on the plain appear instantly. These children were frightened out of one's wits and immediately ran to the town. Only after they got rid of the monster and returned safe and sound, did Dancing Queen find <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>the Teeth Necklace</FONT> gone! The child is really smart, and quickly came to me for help. On hearing the story, I lost no time to chase after the monster out of town all the way here. This is why I am here!
But then what should I do?
I may as well leave.
A good question! I am waiting for you to ask. A moment ago I chased all the way here. It was easy in the beginning. However, on entering the Chapel, I sensed a powerful force of darkness, which made me feel cold.  The Chapel used to belong to our great orthodox school of Church. However, many years ago, it was occupied by horrible demons and monster. All the gallant knights we sent to recapture the place were killed. Look at the bones...How painful!  In order to wipe out the monster here, Dancing Willow, too, ventured into the Chapel to explore.  Speaking of Dancing Willow...Oh! Dear! I am so absorbed in telling you the story that I have almost forgotten why I came here! According to my penetrating vision, the monster who took the necklace should be the grabby <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Obsidian Gargoyle</FONT>.   It has a habit of putting things they took in <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>a small wooden box.</font>, so when you go to find them, be sure to find <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>the small wooden box on them</FONT> and bring it back to me, I guess <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>the Teeth Necklace</FONT> must be inside the box.
Hey! Hey! At such a young age, why are you so coward? If every young man were like you, could we humans survive? You don't want old guys like me to go to battlefield with guns to protect you, do you?
Friend! it is very dangerous here. Go back to pluto quickly!
Hoot! have you found uncle Kasha he chased after those monsters to Corpse Church! Please go there to find him.
The beet wine is surprisingly easy to drink...However, Hengery's drink is better!

Ahaa, ha ha, anyhow you are so strong, and it is ok if you go there once more time. In addition, you can exercise yourself by this chance!   It's good for you having done that! Come on, give me the small wooden box! I can confirm, the necklace is with <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Skeleton Pirate</FONT>!
Really? Don't cheat me. Concealing things is not good behavior.
Beat down <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Obsidian Gargoyle</FONT> quickly to fetch <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>the small wooden box</FONT>! It is rather cold here. I am frozen stiff nearly! And it is so filthy here! I will be poisoned if I continue to stay here,
Hoot! Have you found uncle Kasha? He chased after those monsters to Corpse Church! Please go there to find him.
Why? What are you doing now? Does Justin cheer up? I never said I like him! I just want to bring warmth to the residents here. Warmth okay?
The beet wine is surprisingly easy to drink...However, Hengery's drink is better!   It is strange that every time I drink his beverage, I get butterflies in my stomach...I may as well go and buy some more bottles. Eh? What are you doing here at this moment?

Though Skeleton Pirate is very powerful, I still want to ask you optimistically. Do you get the necklace?
Very easy!
No way
Oh oh! good good...Um! though it is the necklace, no problem, this is not the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Teeth Necklace of Dancing Willow.</FONT>   Well..., I see! This time I will promise you with my life. I will not make mistakes! The thug who wrapped the necklace is--
I don't want to listen, bye!
You better talk right...
Young man, now that you have reached this degree, try again! I hope you can grow well under my training!
Right, definitely! Here, in Corpse Church, it is full of demons. Besides the big devils seizing here, there are many tiger done for the rash. When Dancing Willow went here to do tasks last time, she beaten down the head of the Devil Knight <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Headless horseman</FONT>, and took his head.  According to what Dancing Willow said, that <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Headless horseman</FONT> lurked in a stealth place in the church. Though he can regenerate continually, the head cannot recur. This <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>headless knight</FONT> must hate Dancing Willow, so he came to Meteor Pit to avenge! Fortunately Dancing Queen escape fast, otherwise she had been maltreated by him!   <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Headless Knight</FONT> knows Amplify Damage. As far as he gets the personal articles of Dancing Willow, he can put good to use the Amplify Damage! We must fetch quickly <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Teeth Necklace</FONT>, otherwise Dancing Willow would be dangerous! you give the fake necklace to me firstly, then go quickly to annihilate <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Headless Knight</FONT>!
Really? Don't cheat me. Concealing things is by means the good behavior.
I can confirm absolutely, the bad egg who ran away at the moment he took the necklace, is <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Skeleton Pirate</FONT>! go quickly to rob him of the necklace with him! Go quickly to rob the necklace back with him! go go go.
Hoot! Have you found uncle Kasha? He chased after those monsters to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Corpse Church</FONT>! Please go there to find him.

Great! I knew you have the capacity to do it successfully. You really do not disappoint me. In that case, Dancing Willow should be safe! But...
Didn't it finish?
I don't want to listen!
Ah! It should have been over! But I am a little worried. Where does this <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Teeth Necklace</FONT> come from?  As far as I know, Dancing Willow has never brought such abnormal stuff. But she likes this necklace very much. Could it be given by her boyfriend? This is really a flash-news!
I don't want to study her.
Women are elusive!
Aha! It's right anyway. Well, do you have any interest in studying me? In fact, I like hunting, singing, drinking, and dancing, and...
Hum, you say right anyway! It doesn't matter! It's ok when the stuff is found finally. The <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Teeth Necklace</FONT>... Please entrust it to me! I will bring it to the sisters.  This time I really thank you癒瓊
Sigh~ You young man is too impatient. You were so nervous when I only said but.
We must <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>get</FONT> the Teeth Necklace <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>back</FONT> before the Headless Knight displays his cursed magic! Otherwise Dancing Willow would be in danger.
Hoot hoot! Have uncle kasha been found? My elder sister will be back any time!

Why what are you doing now? Did Justin cheer up? I never said I like him! I just want to bring warmth to the residents here  Warmth ok?

Find Justin to chat what I thought
Dancing Willow recently frequents to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Corpse Church</FONT>. I wonder why does she take risks to that dirty and sick place, for any task so important? I really cannot understand!   You say she likes that <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Teeth Necklace</FONT>. I care about it very much! Wearing jewelry is the last thing Dancing Willow will do, lest such horrific thing! Why, she is the saint knight! And saint knight pursue brightness and sanctity. How does she like such somber thing?
I don't know too!
Maybe from her lover?
You are right anyway. Should I ask you! Such excellent girl as Dancing Willow, should have no relations with you.
Don't talk rubbish! How can Dancing Willow fall in love with man? Through years, she has tried to do as a good saint knight, even more outstanding than many men. Only the one more outstanding than her can match with her.  I, too, need to make success. Only at that time, can I match with her. But that old man Edison, willfully suppresses me, ignores me, and I am frustrated for my talents, really very anguish. Friend, please help me to break away from this plight!
I can help you!
Sorry I have no time
Great! though Edison undervalues me to such degree, I pay attention to his study very much. I know he want to invent nimbus clearing machine. This machine can purify the filth nimbus; as far as we have this kind of machine, we can purify monsters in great quantity, and let monsters surrender without fighting!   In fact, this epoch making great invention, was originally my ideal. But Edison, with his identity of iron making director, usurped this merit from me. I am really very angry; but I am willing to give this honor up to him, for the welfare of the whole human beings.  I have made great effort. At last I studied the energy formula required for this machine. In this <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>notebook</FONT>, are full of my thought and concepts. Please give this <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>notebook</FONT> to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Edison</FONT>!
Don't worry, I'll go now!
No I won't!
Well, finally I have a bosom friend. <font COLOR=#00ff00>Edison's</FONT> laboratory is near to workshop. But he says he want to go Corpse Church, to fetch things he had left before.  Corpse Church is <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>adjacent to Saint Field</FONT>. You can look around there and you may see him! This is my <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>notebook</FONT>. You take it to him. Do remember, don't say it is from me. Otherwise he will get very angry, and we will fail!
Trouble you anyway
You have too many things with you. You need to make clearing first! Otherwise you had better to buy <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>a book on expansion of travelling bag</FONT>. Then you don't need to discard useful things.
Be frank with you, it is not my true idea. But please reconsider it for the purpose of future and world peace of whole human beings!
What...Ok! Since you are unwilling to do so. Then you can go! And forget such unfortunate man as me.
Go to chat with Justin more frequently. I think He will be willing to tell you what he really thinks.
Give the notebook to Edison

Though the study has been done for so long time, and the hull of nimbus clearing machine has been made, yet there is no progress in what on earth energy will be used in purifying nimbus. What kind of energy source or substance on earth can be appliance in manufacturing?
Having a hard time?
Are you stupid?
It is a long story. In fact the reason monsters are so violent and ferocious, all because of their nimbus is grime and wicked; if we can purify this kind of negative nimbus, maybe they can turn into the virtuous species. Hence, the world can refurbish peace!
I can help you!
I have no interest in delusion.
Oh? (looks up and down)  Though we are of science and civilization, and have many gifted lads, I don't know about you... Tell me if you have any ways to help me?
Ah~ I don't mean that.
This notebook is for your reference
Ah! I had no expectations to you originally!
Hum this notebook is... I am very thankful when you send it to me specially. But I am very busy, and perhaps have no time to read...You had better come here to find me later! Perhaps I will have time to read these two days.
Haha! it's hard to say if it is delusion or not. At all events, I will try my best to realize this ideal. Science always situates in the tip most end of the era, and transform impossibility to possibility!
How dare you speak of me in such a way?
Once the study has a breakthrough, I am dedicated in it and forget to eat nor sleep, or even take no step out of laboratory, until the results come out. Because of this, I do not know how many times my wife argued with me, and told me to marry laboratory at best.
Haven't you brought Edison notebook yet! Hurry up! He should have been in <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Saint Field</FONT>, you can find him there.  I specially give you an opportunity to be famous, do not waste it.
You're just the bastard that actually threw my notebook on the road. Unforgivable! Are you really serious about helping me?
Nothing!
I am just careless!
Huh! Then take off!
You still haven't brought this notebook to Edison yet, do you know? Hurry up! He should have been in <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Saint Field</FONT>, you can find him there.
Being sincere, you should put my notebook into my backpack properly. Did it drop from your hands just now? Anyway, you have too much rubbish in your backpack. Now clear a space to put my notebook quickly.

I had decided to name the machine in your name  Sigh... I don't understand why you betray humans and help the Ghosts to fight! How can you face those sacrificed members and their families?
I was wronged!
I don't wanna explain!
I trust you too, but the notebook you brought is poisonous and the Fastfrozon Stone is fake! The turbo is nearly exploding! Well, you may put all these things aside and ignore it, but the morst important is that you stole the important secret when I was busy doing the experiment. All these things were caused by you. How dare you say that you were wronged? How?  Oh a... My heart is hurt...
Maybe there is no such day
What is wrong with you?
Don't worry! I have my own way. Unless you ran away or you died, I would wait for you coming back.
I was poisoned by the notebook... So hurt... Aah... I can cure it but I haven't got the antidote on hand.  enn... So bad--
I will go take it!
Sorry. I will go first.
You... Do you believe me now? Ok, forget it. At last I am poinsoned and I will die soon, I will trust you one more time then.  Okay...

Oh, oh... I feel so bad! I was poisoned all because of you! How can you see me hurt so much without mercy? If I die, can you feel comfortable?
I do not need your explanation. I only hope you may leave here, the further away, the better. I won't see you anymore. If you still will not change back but keep hurting others, I will not let you go! Go now...

Of course! I am the science creator! Maybe I am not a professional pharmacist, but I am enough old not to be cheated! And... How can't I have no antidote by my side?   The reason I sent you to take medicine from Corpse Church, is to test you. If you would had killed me, how could you go and take medicine for me? So, I believe we misunderstood you. Little guy, tell me truth, is this notebook yours?
I don't remember.
I will do it!
Little guy! Why do you hide for him? He is a bad guy who tried to poison me and sends human beings to the hand of ghosts! If you still hide him and if he does something truly bad, how can you make up all these?

Little guy! How do you investigate?
No progress!
I know your purpose!
Keep working! I will see your performance.
Alas! But Justin does not undertand my painstaking work. I tortured him because he is too clever and too proud to work pratically and I want him to know that and change his thinking. I had never thought he went a different way...  I feel too bad to see him like this. He hides his emotions well, and I didn't notice anything... At this point, I noticed that recently those young scientific people drink some health drinks called Hengery.  Those who drink it say that this kind of drink will make you excited and energic and you will have weird experiences or do things you've never done before, and some were punished for those guilty pleasures.
Is he very handsome?
Whats wrong with the drink?
About this... I cannot decide nor give you suggestions. After all, this kind of thing is subjective. This kind of thing started appearing recently, so I don't think there is any correlation.
Correct! I think Hengery found this problem himself, so gave me some drinks to test. After analysis under testing machines, I found there is some special ingredients which can make people dizzy and see illusions!   I've never seen such ingredients. Maybe our scientific chairman knows it, but he lives in San Joel and San Joel is far away from here, so we have to rely on ourselves!  Besides, not only our scientific civilization, but Mainstream has some problems there, too.  It is reported that a knight named <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Wuliu</FONT>, who's worked for the Corpse Church for a long time, was harmed by some ghosts, too. I heard that <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>retired warrior Kasha</FONT> knows something about this. Will you investigate it?
I am going now!
I don't want to go!
Please.
Don't make things awkward.
Hahaha! I will be the one who is the richest, the most famous and the most powerful in the scientific civilization. I will be the king of the world, hahaha...
Ask uncle Kasha to check Wuliu's status.
Ooh... Ooh... Terrible... My sister... She... Is not often at home and each time after she comes back, she locks herself in a room and mumbles to herself, or sometimes she gets angry easily and breaks things. At midnight, there are strange noises and sometimes bats flying out from her room...  she becomes very strange, with red eyes, long teeth, and screams sometimes, or talks to the air...  ooh! Tell me - is my sister crazy?
It's said that Mainstream Knight <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Wuliu</FONT> worked for Corpse Church for a long time so he is often attacked by monsters, and <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>retired warrior Kasha</FONT> is worried about him. Will you talk to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Kasha</FONT>?
Hahaha! I will be the one who is the richest, the most famous and the powerful in scientific civilization. I will be the king of the world, hahaha...
Hey! I met Wuliu when I was returning the Teeth Necklace. She looked very strange with red eyes and white faced. I am so worried.   Tell me, was she attacked by the monsters?
I don't know!
We will investigate it.
I think so! Sigh...
Ok, thank you, little friend!
Report to Edison.
There are waves after waves. It is already bad that Justin does such things! I had not thought Mainstream's Knights would become abnormal in the same way... I don't think these are accidents, but tricks.  No matter what happens, we have to resolve these two things. I will go find Justin later. Talk to him and see what happens to him. As for Knight Wuliu, you have to ask for help from Mainstream! As I know, Wuliu and <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>San Roco</FONT> are good friends. Maybe you should ask him.
I'll go right now!
I am too lazy to go now.
Please! <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>San Roco</FONT> is in <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Holy Plain</FONT>.  I will go to see Justin. See you tonight!
... Then, forget it.
What is wrong with sister? Wuba is so worried.
Hahaha! I will be the one who is the richest, the most famous and the powerful in scientific civilization. I will be the king of the world, hahaha...
I see Wuliu and Wuba from their childhood. And now Wuliu changes into this kind of girl, I am so worried.
Go ask San Roco for Wuliu's information.
What? You know the matter with Wuliu too? Wuba should close her mouth and not talk to strangers. Don't speak about this matter again! After all this is related to Mainstream's reputation. The fewer that know it, the better.
I am on the side of justice.
I will not get involved.
Nnn, You are also from Meteor Pit. I absolutely trust your personality! I have sent Patrols to Corpse Church to investigate Wuliu's case!   But until now, there was no any feedback. I am so worried. I don't know if it is <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>that ghost</FONT> who plays tricks! If it is, it is quite complicated now!
I will die for it!
Ok, bye.
Good, good. You are really good young man from Meteor Pit, so fearlessly! In fact, that monster is <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>lava ghost</FONT> who lives near volcanos. I don't know why he appears in <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Corpse Church</FONT>!   Because he should in a hot circumstance then he may move freely, therefore the one in <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Corpse Church</FONT> has a tough body now and he needs more heat to keep energy and move freely.  Accidently <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Wuliu</FONT> will release some flash lights and they are very hot when she does exercises. <font COLOR=#00ff00>Wuliu</FONT> often goes to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Corpse Church</FONT> for missions. I am worrid that she might use such magic art to attack <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Lava ghost</FONT> but hurted by the rebouncing magic, which caused her abnormal.
I can't help.
How can I help her?
What? Do you release heat too for your magic art? You 'd better not go. We can not sacrifice one to save another one. I don't allow this happen.
<font COLOR=#00ff00>Lava Ghost</FONT> may steal soul and spirit from Wuliu when she attacked him and caused her abnormal. The only way to save Wuliu is to kill <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Lava ghost</FONT>, so that Wuliu will recover!   I should do this myself but I am too busy, so we depend you! Please defeat <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Lava ghost</FONT> and save your partner!
No problem!
No!
Thank you! Don't delay. Go!
No? Then forget it! I often meet your kind, a heroic appearance, but cowardly on the inside.  Go away! Leave my sight.
Wait. Aren't you standing for justice? You retreat so easily, it is a great shame for someone from Meteor Pit!
Enn! I will find a way to save Wuliu and I hope you will not speak about it, please!

I really do not want to do it, but Wuliu is a Knight, I have to report each of her movements... Sorry Wuliu! I do hope the Holyman will save her. I have to leave now, but before I leave, can I ask you to do something?
I am a little tired.
No problem!
That is, 'Saving one person better than buidling 5 towers!' Please do help us!
I don't believe Wuliu changes this way! And I heard that Justin from the scientific world has a similar problem! These two things must be related! I would invesitigate it myself, but I am too busy on Wuliu's case and can not do both!!   As Edison said, Justin drank some drinks with special ingredients so that changed him to this abnormal form; maybe Wuliu drank these kinds of things too, but she never drinks healthy drinks... It seems we have to start from <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>drinking boss Hengery.</FONT>   Young man. I trust your ability and your noble personality! I also thank you for your willingness to kill Lava ghost in Corpse Church. Although Wuliu has not recovered, at least there are fewer ghosts in the world.

I will!
I won't.
I salute you. Come on!

Wuliu is being immature! Right after I told San Roco, he ordered to bring Wuliu.  ... I... Am I wrong?
Give this to that woman?  Don't be silly! They are pretending to be a peacelover... Actually they are ghost partyists coming to destroy humans, called Flower... Something like that.
Didn't I ask you to give that thing to the lady called Flower? Why did not you do it? Go!
Ok, ok.
Easy
Take it, take it!
Your bag is full. Empty it!

There is no other way. Since you are here now... I asked that little boy to send you to the Yiciyuan world. What do you think?
What are you talking about? Did you say that my honey grandchild drank some unknown drink and died? Noo! She loved food from her childhood, and never changed her habbits. Wait, let me use my minds eye and see her spirit...
Did you see something?
What are spirit eyes?
I saw her... So strange! My grandchild looks fine. No problem with her body... But her soul and spirit are gone! My dearest child Biwen Feili! She drank something strange!   Wait... What is the matter? Her soul and spirit fly to a church with many headstones... Aiya! Damn ghosts! Return my grandchild's soul... Ah ...ah... It was takenin... Young man, go take back my grandchild's soul!
How can I find him?
So terrible! I will not do it.
Let me confirm it... The ghosts in the church run here and there. They sucked my grandchild's happiness, anger, fear, hate, love, and desire away!   Damn it! Young man, please go to that <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Corpse Church with head bones</FONT> and take back my grandchild's 7 emotions. Don't be slow!!

So, please be careful and collect back the 7 emotions and take them back. I will resolve it when you come back. Go quickly!

She clearly told me that she would not like not to see the fight between ghosts and humans, she would build a harmonic new peacful world...

Rafa's crisis
Something is wrong with beautiful waitress Rafa. I go to see her and know that she was attacked by a Werewolf when she went to Fujin's Field to pick berry for wines. Then her body changed! What a terrible thing. We have to help her now.
EXP x 4500, GP x 200
Go to Stone Temple Plateau and find waitress Rafa
I feel terrible. My wounds itch and hurt... and there is strange fur... Who are you? Don't approach me!
I came for help.
I just go by.
You can't help me. I will not bother you either. Please go away! Hoo hoo... Ao ao... Ooh! I feel so bad... My body is burning!..
Take care.
Were you attacked by a Werewolf?
Hoo hoo... I feel so bad... I suddenly... want to attack something...
You... How could you know? I only told vice colonel Seroka. Did he tell you? In this case, I will not hide anymore. Last night I went to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Fujin's Field</FONT> to pick berry for wine...  I know it is very dangerous there, but the blackberrys only grow there. Purple Heart Knight protected me on this trip. I had thought there was not any risk, but finally we were attacked... alas! I am so unlucky!... What should I do? So terrible! Please, help me, ok? You may drink wine freely if you come to our Tavern in Meteor Pit in the future...
I have to agree!
I don't drink wine.
Great! I know <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Professor Foka</FONT>. He is studying Werewolfs. Although I know Mainstream knights will help to resolve this... but it is not enough to kill a Werewolf. It still will not save me. So...  Hoo hoo... I am seeking a professional to cure me... Don't tell others on this case. Mainstream knight corps are still reliable, but I still want you to go to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Fujin's Field</FONT> and find <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Professor Foka</FONT> and ask for help. Please!
Woo! I will be very sad if you refuse me... Hoo hoo!
Go away, go away! Go away now! Hoo hoo...
Rafa is our waitress in this Tavern in Meteor Pit. Don't ask! I lost my patience. Go!
Go to Fujin's Field and find Professor Foka.
Ooh, I see the panic on your face. Did you get into trouble? Hahaha! Nothing is impossible. Don't be fraid and don't panic.
Something about Werewolfs
I was born like this.
Ooh haha, you asked the right man. In fact, a Werewolf is a kind of person. They have many sorts and they have own species and systems. What do you want to ask?
Nothing to ask.
What's a Werewolf scratch?
Ooh? Is this the destination you came to today?
Nature Werewolfs has strong magic. They can easily eat their victims or change them into Werewolfs. One type, an <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Enhanced Werewolf</FONT>, cannot control their intentions. Those people bit by them are easily changed into a Werewolf.  Look at your face... Oh haha, were you bit by one?
Yes!
What is so funny?
Don't worry. Take it easy! The <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Enhanced Werewolfs'</FONT> magic is not so powerful. So it is not difficult to cure it. You see! In <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Fujin's Field</FONT>, there are many <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Enhanced Werewolfs</FONT>.  If you were hurted by them, just use their <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Wolf Blood</FONT>, together with some simple medicine, we can make an antidote and cure you. Well, were you really bit by one?
It is my magic dog Laixi!
It was the waitress Rafa.
Aiya! Find a way out! A <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Wolfdog</FONT> is worse than a Werewolf! Ooh haha!
What? The waitress Rafa was bit? Don't delay then. She must briskly go to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Fujin's Field</FONT> or <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Deep Lab Gate</FONT> to pick berries. Alas, luckily the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Enhanced Werewolf</FONT> they are not so powerful.  Go quickly to extract <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>3 drops</FONT> of their <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Wolfblood</FONT> and give it to me. I will make the medicine soon.
Ooh haha! Sorry that I am easily laughing.
Ooh haha! It was a misunderstanding. Ok ok.
I know <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Professor Foka</FONT> is now studying Werewolfs' in <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Fujin's Field</FONT>, please find him... Hoo hoo!
Rafa is a waitress in a Tavern of our Meteor Pit, but she has not come back these two days. She lives in <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Stone Temple Plateau</FONT>, you may find her there.  Don't screw around. I lost my patience. Go quickly!

The mission must be finished.
I don't want to talk to him.
The thing he asked me to go to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Fujin's Field</FONT>, is not guarded by so called Blue Eyed Bats, but more terrible Ghost Strawman. I fought them and found they are more powerful then expected.  Please ask Seroka for me. Did he tell me the wrong place, or that the ghosts change the place?
Frankly, I dislike him, but I understand how you feel...  If so, then I give up!
Thank you for your encouragement. Bye!
Take care! Be careful!
Why are you here again? I don't know where <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Roger</FONT> is.  Tell Rosh about this and ask her to be patient! Don't run away to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Fujin's Field</FONT> by yourself, we have too many people to protect her! Or you may go to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Fujin's Field</FONT> to find <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Roger</FONT>! I suggest you not waste your time. Go away.
Wuu... Father, where are you?... The ghost ahead is strong, Rosh can not pass. Did you go to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Spiritual Land</FONT> to ask <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Seroka</FONT>? He must know your father's status. Please!
Commissioned by Roger, find Seroka
What? Roger is not dead? Is he alive? How can he be? Don't fool me.
I will confirm your order.
Just a joke.
Whaaaaat? I appreciate him so that I let him be a warrior and ask him to replace our Purple Heart Knight then go to Fujin' field to find precious mineral crystals. Who knows he... Forget it! It's not my fault.  Those evil ghosts wander everywhere. I don't work with them. How would I know their tracks?  It's ok if there was a mistake.
Have you taken the crystal back?
Yes. You're right!
Right! Oh! I forgot that you had killed the enhanced Werewolf last time. Looking at you, it seems you will be confident bringing back the crystal! Ha! If you think this is an easy mission, then you are wrong.  If you want to be a hero yourself, I will not stop you. Ok! If you bring back the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>crystal</FONT>, I will not accuse you of Roger's failure.
Please hold your toungue.
But I don't want to go.
Ridiculous! I am the vice colonel of the Purple Heart Knight Corps. I will do what I said. I will wait for you here. Do come back!
Well... aren't you invincible? Why do you look like a coward?
Hnn! You still have a brain, but if you have nothing to say please go away. I am too busy to accompany you.
Bastard! How dare you make fun of me! Are you so anxious to die?
Please ask Seroka for me, if he told me the wrong place or if the ghosts changed places.
Wuuu... Father, where are you? The ghosts ahead are so powerful. Rosh cannot pass.
Report the information to Roger
Did you say that Seroka asked you to replace me and to go take the crystal? Alas, I am so sorry. Sorry for the grievance.  Seroka played tricks. He cannot take me on and now he put you into danger. I think we may put this matter aside. Let me find a solution myself to get that thing. You'd better leave.
I promised Rosh.
Then take care.
Rosh... I am only worried about my daughter now. She lost her mother when she was very small. And she lives with such a rough man and encounters many difficulties. I feel very sorry for her.  For her, I will hold on! Then please help me to get the Aries Crystal and then we get back... Eeewuu...
Are you injured?
I am ok. Just now I fought against a <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Ghost strawman</FONT> and I was beaten by them... Aaah, My chest hurts!
How can I help you?
Then please have a rest.
I was wounded by the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Ghost strawmans</FONT> poisonous fists. I need the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>antidote</FONT>, but I...  Err! I am so hurt! I will count on you now. I am useless. I can't finish the mission, but I will get you into trouble! Sigh...
Ok!... Eeer... My chest hurts so much!
Thank you! You take care too... Alas! Rosh... Please pray for your daddy!
I am right here waiting for you. Do come back!
Wuuu... Father, where are you? The ghosts ahead are so powerful. Rosh can not pass.
Get the Healing Medicine and give it to Roger.
Obtain Task Item: Healing Medicine %d / %d
Is... Is this the Healing Medicine? Thank you... Drinking it  Oooo! This medicine is so bitter and smells bad. No wonder it is made by ghosts, but I feel better now. My chest is still aching. So please help me get that crystal.  <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Aries Crystal</FONT> is a thing with special power. I only know that Purple Heart Knights want it, but I do not know the actual use of it. Sorry. I can not answer your question.  As for the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Aries Crystal</FONT>, it lies in <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Southwest of Fujin's Field</FONT> and in its <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Colorful crystals</FONT>. There are many ghost strawmen guarding there. Please be very careful. I will wait for you here. Go!  If you do not find the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>antidote</FONT>, I can not let you go by yourself. You can beat Ghost strawman and get the medicine, which proves that you are more powerful than me. In order to finish the mission sooner and bring the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Aries Crystal</FONT> to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Seroka</FONT>, please do it.
<font COLOR=#00ff00>The Antidote</FONT> is on the<FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Ghost strawman</FONT>, please go get it!

If you want more, come dig more.
Ah! There are more and more heroes in each age, new heroes and old heroes! You are so young but you defeated those terrible ghosts! I am really angered. Our human beings have heroes like you, we are so lucky!   My chest is still aching and I am afraid this will delay your way back. So please take this <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Aries Crystal</FONT> back to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Seroka</FONT> by yourself!
Then how about you?
Go with me!
I am fine. The nearby ghosts are weak and cannot hurt me. The mission is more important. Hurry. Take this crystal to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Seroka</FONT>!
No! It is more important to finish this mission. Please take this crystal to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Seroka</FONT>. The ghosts are weak here and cannot hurt me. Don't worry. Go!

Of course it is true.
Don't take it.
I will test it and know if it is true. Ok! Now you can go.  Wait, if you have nothing to do, please go to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Fujin's Field</FONT> and bring back <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Rosh</FONT>. It is dangerous for her to be there alone. I have many things to do and cannot send men to protect her.
Hnnn! You are so confident! Ok I trust you but I will know if it is true after I test it. Ok now. You can go.

Please bring the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Aries Crystal</FONT> to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Seroka</FONT>, please!
Don't you find that you have dropped your crystal? Not in this way! I'd better bring it back by myself... Ewuu... My chest is hurt...
Give it to me!
Take care!
... Ok! But you should be more careful. Don't drop it again.
Ok... But your bag is full!
Eeer...
Wuuu... Father, where are you? The ghosts ahead are so powerful. Rosh can not pass.
Whose trick?
Roger was found in Fujin's Field. Things look strange. We need more detailed investigation.
EXP x 10000, GP x 300
Go to Spiritual Land to see Seroka
You poisonous snake! You hurt me in this way! I can't see anything! I am blind! You have your aim now! Damn it! Help! Please catch him!
Please let me explain.
I go first.
Liar! You liar! From the time you lied to me saying that Roger was alive, I should have captured you! I pretended to play games with you. I thought I was a clever person. How can a Purple Heart Knight defeat evil bad guys?
I swear I am innocent.
You are the bad guy!
Liar! The explosive <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Aries Crystal</FONT> you brought back is not the one <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Mineral crystal</FONT> I want. Can you deny this?  <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Aries Crystal</FONT> is a very dangerous thing! It will explode if it feels any ghostly spirits! It is similar to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>mineral crystal</FONT>. You just want to kill me. Disgusting!
Roger asked me to take it.
Right!
You still lie until now! Roger died half a month ago when he went out for a mission and was attacked by double-children Mummies. He sacrificed himself! Considering that his daughter was too young, we Knight Corps can not tell her so we buried him.  His tomb stone is right in <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>southwest Fujin's Field</FONT>! He died suddenly and his soul may be still there. So if you take <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>ten double-children mummies' souls</FONT> to sacrifice him, maybe there is some reaction.
I know!
So many troubles.
Hnnn! Go away!
Hnnn! Go away!
Damn it! I will teach you. Somebody help me!
Alas! You are the betrayer of our human beings. I will not give in. I will clear my eyes so you  should be careful. Our Purple Heart Knight will have revenge!
Don't run away! Somebody help! Anybody here? Catch this bad guy!
Ha ha ha ha... Ha ha ha...
Wuuu... Father, where are you? The ghosts ahead are so powerful. Rosh can not pass.
Kill ten double-children mummies and then go to Roger's tomb

Aaa! Ghost!
Alas! I am dying! The restless soul makes me talk. Not a long time later, if the soul is dismissed, I will be dismissed to!
Rosh sent me here
I want to see your face.
Aaaa! Rosh, Rosh, my dear child. Daddy is so sorry that he can not see you growing up. I cannot take care of you. That was the only pity of my life.  Young man. Can you do me a favor?
At your service.
On the tombstone there is a <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Red Heart Necklace</FONT>, and there is a picture of my family. Please bring this necklace to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Rosh</FONT> and tell her that even if my mother and I are not alive, we will still stay with her and take care of her. When she is lonely, ask her to cry to the heavens and we will hear her. Although we can not hug her or feel her temperature, we will love her forever, forever...
I will tell her
You talk too much
Thank you! My restless soul is better now. If the soul is dismissed, I will leave this world forever. I know there is a trick but I can not stop it now.  Brave man! Please open your eyes, recognize those evil ghosts who pretend to be human beings. If you can not distinguish them, please seek help from my friend, a wondering taoist Power Peak. He will guide you.  As for this <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Red Heart Necklace</FONT>, please keep it well and bring it to my daughter <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Rosh</FONT>.
Please clear a free space in your bag for this necklace!

I know. My father looks at this necklace every night... And now he give it to me... Wuuu, I know my father will never return. Right?
Sorry!
What can I do for you?
Wuuu! Father will not come back even if you apologize.  Yes! Father has a very good friend <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Uncle Power Peak</FONT>. I heard that he goes to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Stone Temple Plateaus</FONT>. He is a very powerful man. Please go find him, maybe he may help me.

You lied to me! I want my father. Please help me find him ok? Wuuu...
I have been here waiting for my father for several days, but father still has not come back...
Father... Why don't you come back? Rosh misses you so much!
Please bring this <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Red Heart Necklace</FONT> to my daughter <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Rosh</FONT>!
Young man. You forgot to take this Red Heart Necklace.  Please help me!
I know!

Ha ha ha ha... Ha ha ha...
Go to Stone Temple Plateaus and find Power Peak.
Ee! Your man. I saw the worry on your face. What's the problem with you?
Nothing...
Something about Roger...
It is good if there is no problem. If you have some difficulty, please tell me. Two men are always smarter than one. Although I am not a very smart man, maybe I can give you some suggestions for small matters.
Sigh! I heard about the accident of Roger. He was a brave and strong warrior. We are so sorry that he died at such a young age. I would like to take care of his orphan daughter... What? Did you say there is another Roger in Fujin's Field?  ... Damn it! It must be the one imitated by a ghost. Some ghosts may transform their bodies, and change their appearances. Some of them can transform into humans. If they have information of the target, it is easy to imitate.
Oh! Thank you...
How can I verify?
You are welcome. Come to ask me if any other question.
Damn it! The ghost imitated my friend Roger! What trick are the ghosts playing?... You said that you had believed other peoples words and caused somebody to go blind?  Unforgivable! These ghosts not only do bad things, but also ruin my friend's reputation! I can't let this happen freely. Young man. Please find a free space in your bag. I have something for you and it will help you to make those fake fellows turn back to real creatures.
Ok!
Not good!

Why do you imitate Roger?
I love to do it!
I, I am Roger. What is wrong with you? Set me free! I can not move!
Ghost! No more imitations!
But I can not remove it.
You... Damn it! You found out! According to my plan, Seroka is going to explode and die! Hahaha! It is a very good deal to kill the vice colonel of Purple Heart Knights!
Did I say that he was dead?
He is not dead? Impossible! The Aries Crystal explosion is very powerful. He can not survive! Hnnn!! I am the famous assassinating Ghost party soldier, I will never lose. That Roger was killed by me too, so I will never fail!    Roger can't survive. You may go back to find him. I am sure there is only a dead body now!
... You bastard! I would kill you if I could move!

I am not interested in this.
You look fine and in good health. You should be good. Is your familiy member ill?
Let me tell you
You are so unlucky!

Are you sure? Vice colonel is badly injured. We cannot delay.

Hey! When I was young, I had no such interest either. From that case... Sigh! Kid, you are still  too young. You will know it once you encounter it.
<font COLOR=#00ff00>Erika</FONT> is a good man, without a master to understand. If you want to learn medicine, you may attend his lectures.  It is said that he lives near <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Northeast Fujin's Field</FONT>. You can go and find him.

Hey! You come again. I just looked at some information and I found an astonishing thing! Have you ever heard of the ghost of <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Crazy doctor</FONT>? So terrible! There are butcher ghosts, doing experiments on human bodies to enhance their own power!   I heard that their eye balls can see on any creatures after rebuilding. So, if you can acquire the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Magic eyes</FONT> of <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Crazy doctor</FONT>, maybe you may cure Seroka's eyes. What do you think?

I am not strong enough.
Of course I will.
Ah!! IF you die only for a pair of eyes. It is unreasonable! I will find other ways.
Great! I saw on my way here, that the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Crazy doctor</FONT> is in <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Fujin's Field</FONT>, wandering there. You may go there and if lucky, you may find them.

Did you mean Doctor Erika asks me to go there? He will do a surgical operation for my eyes?  This... Is ok. I will go there after I have finished these things. Thank you so much!
My pleasure.
Although you caused injury to my eyes, you have tried your best to make up for it. Ok! I forgive you. Although there is a risk for the operation, I really thank you!   One more thing, you said the one <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>imitating Roger</FONT> is locked by you. I am still a little worried. There must be a bigger trick behind this.

Have you ever thought this?   <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Kishira</FONT> is a doubtful woman. If you can take <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Crystal Bomb</FONT> from her, you are great! Hahahaha...
Yaa! Brave young man. You are still here. What can I do for you?
Do you know Kishira?
I am just passing by.
Kishira is my sister in law. Well, do you want to ask her to let you join the Purple Heart Knights?
Here are the facts.
I am not interested.
... Enn... Keep talking... Ayaa! All these are tricks of ghost party! No wonder Silk Honey was attacked suddenly and caused me to misunderstand these people.  As for the crystal ball you mentioned. I really saw it. It seemed some stranger gave it to my sister in law Kishira. It is brilliant and very beautiful. I had never thought it is such a terrible thing.
So, what shall I do?
In this case, I will not care about it.
It is ok. I have a solution. Please give me a free space in your bag. Then I will tell you how to do.
Ok. I will clear it.
No! The things in my bag are so precious!
I have a <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Jade Ring</FONT>. My sister in law likes it very much. I have not thought to give it to others, but since it is an important case, I have to contribute!   Take this and tell her that I would like to exchange this <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Jade Ring</FONT> to her <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>crystal</FONT>, she will be happy to accept it.
You are lying. Your bag is still full!
Nothing is more precious than life!   Please consider it. What kind of thing is more important than your life?
Please don't! Do help me please!
Sigh! What a pity! You have such good talent and boldness. It is a great waste if you do not join us.  Will you reconsider again?
Oh! That is it! Thank you so much for last time. Silk Honey is much better now. We will go back to Meteor Pit. Will you come with me?
Go away if you have nothing else. Don't delay my mission. I will go to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Thunder hill</FONT> to find <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Myan</FONT> and Kishira. Or will you go for me? Hnnn!

Sorry! I will be careful.
I am intentional.
Carefully take it!
You bag is full. Set a free space for me.
You make me upset... Shall I really give it to you?
Isn't this Jade Ring of Myan? I love it so much. Strange! Why is this ring in your hand?
This is not for you.
She sent me to give it.
What? (disappointed) Oh! Then... If you have no other things, please go away... Fast!
Ah... Haha. Really? She was unwilling to give me this before... Thank you! Wait, here is a letter. Let me see it...  ... What? That evil ghost! How dare he attack my lovely Silk Honey! Damn it! They played so many tricks!... Ah! I know the case of Roger. What a great pity... and, I had thought Seroka's eyes were wounded because of you, but they were wounded by those evil ghosts! It seems we misunderstood you.
I am glad you know it now.
Ah... Haha... So sorry! I am just curious why she is giving me this crystal ball. It is the ghost who wants to kill me. Our Purple Heart knights are all brave and durable, we will never retreat or be frightened   Take this Crystal Bomb away. Be careful and don't break it. If it explodes, this town will be destroyed.
Leave it to me!
No! I am afraid.
Hurry... Take this!   One more thing, take this <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Exlposive Crystal</FONT> to that <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>fake Roger</FONT>. Ha ha ha... Let he know what is called killing oneself while injuring others.

Oh! Here comes our hero! Well, do you come and thank me, the vice colonel of Purple Knight corps? Hahaha. Ok ok. If I had not tried my best to protect this Crystal Bomb, you had no chance to resolve this case so smoothly. But I am a good judge. Although you made not much of a contribution, you have offered so much, so here is a small prize for you. Thank you for your help for our Purple Knights! Please take it.

Alas. This jade ornament is so precious for me. I hope you may find my wife with it at earlier time. Don't lose it. Good luck!
It is ok you lost something, but please clear your bag for free space.
Do you represent my lord Hiaron to save Lady? Great! I had thought Hiaron lost his spirit! But now I know things are changing.
What is your intention for you to inquire for the Lady? Are you a leecher? Go away! Don't approach our ma'am!

Beautiful mistake
The fact is that Hiaron's wife Yuri 's soul was taken by Demon lord's soldier to Tartarus Castle, while her body is still in her home with her husband. Yuri's soul was polluted by Pluto's spirit. You have to collect the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Purification Stone</FONT> for Yuri.

(the mystical <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Treasure box</FONT>. You have to open it a special way!)
Too bad! It seems I am late! Easily talking, <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>you were used by Indie God</FONT>! He just wanted you to help him come back to life, and to realize his ambition to control this world!  In the past, <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Indie God</FONT> is the highest priest of Egypt, but he had relations with King Namu 's wife <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Alibella</FONT>. The king was very angry and punished him! <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Indie God</FONT> was an honorable person at that time, King namu was afraid the people would be angry to see the highest priest executed, so he declared that Indie God died accidently and he gave Indie God a noble funeral like a king to calm down the people. So King Namu dug out <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Indie God</FONT>'s bowels and put into 4 Canopic jars, the way he treated noble mummies. King Namu did not want to give Indie God a chance to revive, so he gave those jars to the pyramid guards and arranged many barriers! King Namu's wife <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Alibella</FONT> was captured in the palace since she could not be forgiven by the king. After she died, her mummy was kept in a secret chamber, her name was forbidden to be listed in the ancestors books as punishment!  Frankly, our <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Ghost party</FONT> had thought to use reliving curses to recall Indie God's evil soul, and use his power to help us control the world! We did not think Indie God was ready to strengthen his own power and sought the way to reunite his soul and his body to come back to life. So he colluded with Alibella and asked you <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>to get Canopic jars</FONT>... Since you opened this treasure box, it disturbed the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Bastet the Goddess</FONT> who guards the treasure box. Indie God is just finding an excuse to kill you... Now I can feel the powerful evil aura of <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Indie God</FONT> spreading in the north. Only one person knows how to make Indie God sleep forever again.
Tell me who!
In fact, this person is descendant of Egyptian priest, <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Zidon</FONT>. Although he is our enemy, now it is more important to eliminate Indie God 's power! So I hope you go to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Death Valley</FONT> and find him. He will tell you what to do.

If you're in the process of deciding whether to be a Knight or Demon Slayer, I'm sure you'd like to talk to Warrior General. I hear Arthur will not only help you decide, but even have you solve a great problem that has fallen upon Warrior Society. I'd like you to depart as soon as you get the general idea.

Finally. Alright, looks like you're all pumped up. We Warrior Societys will definitely succeed with your help. You're the young one whom Arthur trusts with everything, right? You came here to help on his orders, right?
Yep, that's me!
What?
Finally. I'm good at scouting, but battle is not my forte. The monster that's taken control of Marianne is hiding in a secret room in Corpse  Church. He isn't some young handsome boy, but rather a notorious vampire king known as a  woman killer. In order to remove the spell cast on Marianne, we need to defeat the vampire king and remove its fang. But it's too difficult for you alone. Of course, if you insist, I won't stop you. Once you're ready, I'll tell you how to get to the secret room.
Then what did you come here to do? Get out of here! Gogogo, get out of here!
So, did you find the devil of Corpse Church?<PF>No? Then don't you think you should talk to Leonor, who's doing reconnaissance work there?<PF>Now hurry! We don't have any time to waste!

Just a little bit?
What's next?
Yeah, that's right.<PF>According to my sources, before using his magic on Marianne, the vampire gave her a powerful poison. She was affected by the magic easily because the poison had already destroyed her heart.<PF>This poison is a potion that Thousand Year Tree Monsters make to control young women. Only Tree spirits of blackish green trees can cancel its effect.<PF>Take a little break for now. I'll tell you where that old monster is then.

Continue investigating
Even if we dispel the vampire king's control, we still need to remove the effects of the poison. However, only monsters older than 1000 years have the power to do that. I believe Allen, who was paired with Leonor did research in that area before. Once you defeat the vampire king, <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>find Allen by the Plague Dungeon of Meteor Pit</FONT>

What's so special about them?
Please tell me what is special
These monsters are good at magic, and have an incredibly smelly aura, so it's difficult to even scratch them with a regular sword. If you don't watch out, you'll get poisoned as well, so it's a lot harder to fight them than  Vampire King.<PF>But it looks like luck's been on your side so far, so if you manage to defeat them, don't forget to grab their heart. Otherwise your efforts would've been in vain.<PF>Alright, enough gossip for now. Just get those items in your bag. Once you're ready, I'll tell you where they are.

How to find the monsters
Because she plays so much hide and seek, she's also good at finding where monsters hide. She finds the hidden rooms in Corpse Church that bothersome monsters hide in almost instantly. Vampire King, who loves to tempt her, finds pleaseure in dragging people into a cycle of desires. In order to dispel it, you must <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>take</FONT> his <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>fangs</FONT>.

Of course! According to my sources, the Vampire King, besides pulling people down  with temptation, also make them drink a poisonous syrup.<PF>The syrup makes the drinker's soul get sucked out.

The other ingredient
There is another ingredient we'll be needing. That's the Tree Spirit of Blackish Green Tree, that monsters over 1000 years carry. From what I hear, Shu's quiet old brother Dalasnikov who was researching with him has the information.

Dalasnikov found an elder monster that has a <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Tree Spirit of Blackish Green Tree</FONT>. They're in the hidden room with <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Black Wind Grandmas</FONT>. However, we need to go down to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Plague Dungeon B3</FONT>, where there are many monsters that wield magic, so we need to wait for reinforcements. Of course, we're happy you're here, but it's important not to spread out too much. The Black Wind Grandmas who use magic cleverly are harder to fight than the Vampire King! So it's probably a good idea to fight with plenty of friends.

Your bag is already full! Clean it out please! Or I can't give you the Water Portion  Blending Deadly Water.
Mm? How are you suited to be a Gunslinger? And you want me to make you a Spirit Wave  Helmet?<PF>If you're still that undecided, just quit this mission.<PF>Talk to Darasnikov about this from the start again! Then if you still want me to make you a Spirit Wave Helmet, then come back again!
Mm~ You're getting forgetful! I can only make it with both the Vampire Fang and Tree  Spirit of Blackish Green Tree. Don't forget! I can't make it if you're missing even one!
Return to Meteor Pit and report to Bacherikov
The Deadly Poisoned Water Potion contains two poisons, and when they enter the body, they form antibodies, Making the monster's poisons become ineffective.<PF>Young one, it's amazing! By understanding the properties of everything, you can make amazing things. This is the joy and surprise that Gunslingers brought to this world. Congratulations, from now on you are an erudite Gunslinger.

Return to Meteor Pit and report to Bacherikov
The Spirit Wave Helmet cleanses spiritual energy, and brings people who've lost their  mind back to sanity. It's like a pacifier, but it's a lot more powerful.<PF>This is all because of the evil spiritual energy that the Vampire King and Black Wind Grandmas have spread, *sigh*.... Using various materials and making many peculiar mechanisms, that's the Archer's specialty.<PF>Congratulations, you are now officially a reliable Archer.

Blessings and luck from Heaven
To you, who have yet to decide between being a Taoist and Exorcist, Kansinro didn't help you out at all, and only told you about the unexpected problems Mages faced, and asked you for help.

You're still here? Hurry up and go!
Special mediation
To think that you'd absorb a blended dark spiritual power to get magical powers! That's terrifying, but now is not the time. Now we can save people with this blended evil spiritual energy. Kansiro found Black Wind Grandmas in a hidden room in Plague Dungeon. I'm planning on taking the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Tree Spirit of Blackish Green Tree</FONT> from them. However, Kansiro isn't good at fighting, so he's waiting for a godsend. Now! Defeat the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Black Wind Grandmas</FONT>!

You need another material?
Yes, this special mediation is lacking a type of dark energy, so it will won't properly  blend with dark spirit, causing minute differences in the effects.<PF>Besides the Tree Spirit of Blackish Green Tree, we also need a difficult-to-obtain  material, the vampire fang.<PF>Take a break.

Tououro managed to find the Vampire King who has the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Vampire Fang</FONT>, but it's in a hidden room down in <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Corpse Church</FONT> B1, where a lot of fighting is necessary, so he can't get the fang himself.

My my, are you the young one Moka was talking about? Are you also troubled by  something?
Mmhmm...
Are you troubled?
Don't worry too much! As long as you're healthy, good things will come.
Yes. I'm worried. There is no parent who would be happy looking at her son's troubled  face.<PF>Eric never really told me much since he was small. He was always a quiet one, and recently he talks to me even less. Since you're young, maybe you can talk to him.
Where is he?
I'm not feeling too well...
He went to Trial Field all alone. It's quiet there, so I guess he can think.<PF>But I'm worried! Could you go find him and tell him to come back?
Oh, don't worry so much, and if anything is bothering you, I'm sure you'll feel better if  you talk to your friend.<PF>Of course! As long as you're healthy, there's no need to worry so much, even if things  aren't looking up.

What can I do? The outside world is scary......... But if I stay like this forever, will somebody take down the king of monsters?<PF>If I try hard enough... I might even be able to become the savior of mankind...... But what if I can't? If I die, I wouldn't be able to see mom anymore, nor will I be able to come back here.
What happened?
You coward!
Shut up! Who are you? Leave me alone!
What! I'm... I'm no coward, I'm just... just thinking about my future here.<PF>Stop making false accusations! I... I've already decided to leave here and go to the mainland and defeat monsters with allies. But... I'm just wondering what to do right now.
It's true!
Tell me about it
Shut up! Who are you? Don't tell me mom told you something weird! Tell her to just leave me alone!
Okay... sure!<PF>In order to fight monsters, you need to train and attain various skills. Warriors who specialize in physical combat, Mages who defeat enemies with spells, Shamans who save people with the power of nature, Machinists who love science and engineer things. I'm still not sure what I'm meant to be though.
Save the world?
What are your hobbies?
Of course by defeating all monsters and not letting them ever come back! Ugh... Dad was killed by them! I can never forget this anger.<PF>But my body is weak, unable to wield a sword, don't particularly have an affinity to nature, don't even like reading notes...

Sad Love Song
In order to defend Belkana, his loved one, Blijan fought fiercely. However, in order to distract the monsters, Blijan got separated from Belkana. Belkana is incredibly worried. She wants you to look for Blijan as you enter the cave.
Exp x200, Gold x10
Search for Blijan in the depths of Trial Cave.
You still haven't found Blijan? Please hurry! I really don't want my parents to find out about this.
You... You're looking for me for Belkana? Ha... Haha... That stupid woman! I didn't love her from the start. She just kept following me. I was sick of her. So I tried to chase her out of the village. But... to think that I'd get into a situation like this. It's over...
Keep trying!
You're a jerk!
It's alright... I know myself best. I'm going to die soon... I never loved Belkana at all. The one I loved... was Silspira... Whatever, it's all over now... Take this ring... And tell Belkana to forget about me, and take care of herself.
Haha... It's just as Belkana's parents said... I really am a jerk... But Belkana still doesn't know this about me...

Have you still not found Blijan? Hurry please! I can't have my parents know about this.
Just go and... Tell Belkana to go home... and forget about me...

Quest Target: Magical Book %d / %d
Blijan wasn't in the Magical Book? I... guess I already figured. Blijan is already... *sob*... I just didn't have the courage to accept that, and pretended to not know... Blijan... What should I do... This is all because of the monster. I can never forgive them! *sob*... Thank you very much. You know that you can get out of her by going to Preacher Daltanian, right? And even though you helped me so much and listened to my please, this is all I can give you. Please take it. Become stronger, and keep moving forward. I've decided to go back home and train again. Once I become stronger, I'll defeat all the monsters here and take avenge Blijan.

Right! I told you it was hard! Ahhh... What am I to do?

Exp x20, Gold x5
Go to Trial Field and talk to Eric
Hey! You're back! After talking to you, I finally decided to leave. But I still haven't been able to. I'm untalented, so I probably can't avenge my dad, but... It really sucks to be brave but lack everything else. I need to plan everything out and train myself.
Eric is hanging around in Trial Field and I'm worried for his safety, so can you go find  him?
Looking for Belkana
At night, the fun-loving Jidy followed his sister and arrived at Trial Cave. But he's afraid of the dark and couldn't enter the cave. He ended up deciding to wait for his sister outside the cave. Night came and it gradually got darker. He was dressed lightly, and from fear and cold, began crying...

Open the Umbra Guide
According to the mysterious child, the one tear that the Princess from Heaven gave him, coupled with the his bravery and faith, allowed him to summon his own Umbra Guide. Also, once the Umbra Guide is activated, by defeating a monster, its card is automatically collected.

Beginning of a Bond
It looks like Martak is in a big hurry. He lost his <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Warrior Badge</FONT>, the proof that he is the leader of the Warrior Army when he went to Thunder Hill. However, he has work and cannot leave the spot. Can you help him? You just need to go to Thunder Hill and find it. Martak said that he remembers asking directions to a <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>pretty girl walking near the bird statue</FONT>. Maybe that is a clue. Either way, there are no other tips. It looks like asking her is the only option.

Did you pick anything up?
I think so too
Something? I really don't know what you're talking about!

Oh, you're talking about that small pretty thing!<PF>...I have it! I was planning to lie about it.<PF>Is this that important? Fine, I'll give it back to him...

Thank you, thank you, thank you again!<PF>That girl really was beautiful~ I want to get to know her... Do you think she'd welcome me if I went to visit her? That's... that's a little much, huh...

Hmph! So he really got angry.<PF>So I guess I'm your only saving grace! ...But, it won't be easy having me help you. I want you to do something for me!
Give me a break

I need the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Blue Ocean Pearl</FONT> inside their body. First, collect <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>5 of them</FONT> and bring them to me. Because if I make you carry too many, you'd get tired.
Really? What a useless fool.

Quest Item:  Defused Explosive Hormone %d / %d
Young one, that's a curious thing you're holding... Let me see?
Please clean it
Curious?
Ahh! This is terrifying! This was without a doubt created by monsters! They took the Explosive Hormones out of live humans.<PF>Truly terrifying... I will take away these monstrous powers... I added a digestive pill to it, so its power should all be gone now.<PF>Now this is completely worthless! You can just go throw it away...<PF>Or actually, do you want to fight the monsters?
Perhaps, that's why you gave me the Explosive Hormone.
This is now a Defused Explosive Hormone! If you don't believe me, go try it out on some monsters.
Did you get it? Hehehe... Hand it over! I must prepare the bloodbath in Meteor Pit!  Hehehe...
Ahhh... What is this? It hurts... You traitor! I'll never forgive you... Hohoho... One of me has died... Still millions of others.. Did you think that destroying me would prevent this disaster?<PF>Hehehe... There are still many monsters hiding in the city! We may not be able to bomb it, but we still have many ways of destroying this place... Why don't you try finding them one by one... Hehehe... Ahhhhhh...
What are you still doing here? Hurry and get the Explosive Hormone from Frankenstein. He's probably in Spiritual Land!

The Next Battlefield
Ell, who turned back to normal, heard of a monster incident in Holy Plain. If you're skilled enough, of if you just want a challenge, you should give it a shot.

You lost it again?!   Alright, here is another one. However, you need to leave some space for another Lily Fruit.
Solve the Misunderstanding
I realized that I was caught in a trap after talking to Dangimoon -- you know, how he explained about Musion inexplicably kicking him out. And so to prove my innocence, I decided to follow Dangimoon's advice and ask<FONT COLOR=#00ff00> Emma</FONT>.
Exp x900, Gold x150
Question Emma
... So you came! I knew you'd come.
Why would you do this
I'm getting angry
I was just joking! Why so serious? Just chill!<PF>Oh, so did he punch you?
He doesn't want to talk
We're pretty close
He's so moody. I guess I'm the only one that can save you now! ...But I don't want to help you out that easily. I'll have you do a few things for me first!
Give me a break
What do I need to do?
Do as you please. Seeing as how he is so simple-minded, he'll never speak to you.
I guess you really want to prove your innocence as soon as possible, huh! Okay, I won't bother you anymore after this!<PF>First, go to Spiritual Land to the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Severely-Injured Man</FONT>. I need the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Rotten Bones</FONT> they have.<PF>I guess <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>5</FONT> will do for now.
Really? I guess he's a calm guy!
Don't get mad, I was just messing with you guys. It never crossed my mind that you guys would buy it! ...Interesting!
I think you need to put a stop to that girl.<PF>If you didn't have a conversation like that, you have to have her prove your innocence.
I don't want to talk to you any more.

How long are you going to make me wait? Before I change my mind, get <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Rotten Bones</FONT> from the bodies of <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Severely-Injured Man</FONT>! Or else I won't help you out!
I think you need to put a stop to that girl.<PF>If you didn't have a conversation like that, you have to have her prove your innocence.

Oh, What a good smell!  This rotten smell that pervades this area this area...... It really brings back my energy! <PF>With these two items and the Poison Fungus Powder, ask him to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>create</FONT> a <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Poison Honey</FONT>. And, make sure you ask the best perfumer to conduct this quest, got it? <PF>By the way, the Healing Breath Essence that you made last time, that was pretty good. So, why not ask the same person that created that to complete this quest.
No way!
Give me that thing. I'll try
Oh? Really? Well then, let's call quits! I'm not the one that'll suffer.
I'll leave that to you! Deliver the ingredients you have to him, along with this Powder of the Poison Mushroom. After that, ask him to create a <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Poison Honey</FONT> and bring that back to me.
Come back after you organize your bag.
What's the matter?  Couldn't gather up the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>secret medicine that</FONT> <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Shack the Ripper</FONT> uses every day?  I really thought you were up to this quest!
I think you need to put a stop to that girl.<PF>If you didn't have a conversation like that, you have to have her prove your innocence.
I don't want to talk to you any more.
Deliver the ingredients for the Poison Honey to Lydu
Quest Item: Poison Fungus Powder

Receive Poison Honey from Lydu
Restless? Well then, go defeat some <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Stone Gargoyles</FONT> outside.<PF>I've wanted to teach them a lesson for a while. Take down at least <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>5</FONT> of them!
I've never made such a ludicrous thing, so it took me a while.
What happened to my Poison Honey?  It's not done yet?
Defeat 5 Stone Gargoyles
Quest Target: Stone Gargoyle %d / %d
Finally! It's done. Man, that almost killed me. <PF>Come over here, let me show you. This is the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Poison Honey</FONT>. <PF>I don't know what you're going to use this for, but  at least keep track of where you're heading with this!

I'll change her into a cactus! Ha ha ha. I was just saying whatever came into my head at the time. I didn't think they would believe everything I said blindly. Sorry for the inconvenience! <PF>Well, who does she think she is! For goodness sake!<PF>I almost went against the beliefs of the Spiritual Master and did something to her that I wouldn't have been able to take back! Sorry. I got too excited! No, no.<PF>Us Nature Tribe always seek peace and beauty. Even if it was a mistake, having an image of destruction...... Take a deep breath. Breathe~, breathe again ~sigh~.......<PF>Hrumph! I wouldn't advise you to take this letter.
I think you need to put a stop to that girl.<PF>If you didn't have a conversation like that, you have to have her prove your innocence.

I'll be going now
Read the Pure White Letter
Sigh! If you are thinking about confessing and changing your beliefs,  then it is never too late. <PF>I don't want you committing bad deeds anymore.
............This kid looks like she is incapable of being cured. I can't believe that she fooled us with such a blatant lie! <PF>Her personality was not something that was correctable -- either with the Charity Record or the Healing Aroma......<PF>Goodness! I have to admit that I share some responsibility for this incident. I truly regret my actions. Please forgive me! <PF>I shouldn't have acted so impulsively. I guess I revealed my undisciplined side. I'm really sorry. <PF>I don't know what to say, but uh......well, this is a little something for you.
I don't want to talk to you any more.
I don't think it would be best to show this letter to Musion. To tell you the truth, such a letter makes me sick!<PF>But without this letter, it's impossible to resolve the misunderstanding......Well, there's no other way than for you to decide on your own.
Oh... This tastes so great. It might stick with me for a long time.
Stacking Suspicions
Who is this Emma woman who's trying to gain Musion's attention through such base actions? Musion has his own thoughts and questions about her, but in order to save the poor stray sheep, Musion asked you to gather information about Emma.

You want to know about Emma!<PF>She's sort of holy...<PF>She came here about a month ago. She worshipped our society and wanted to study it.<PF>She would always be smiling, and many young ones are attracted and crazed by her.<PF>Oh, but I see her playing at Holy Plain sometimes. I have no idea what she does there though!
What is she doing?
I'm interested
If you search for her in <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Holy Plain</FONT>, maybe you'll meet her. However, the monsters that appear in the night are particularly dangerous - be careful!<PF>Oh, and when you come back, please report to me. I'm sure many young ones are interested in her.

One, she's actually a halfblood human and monster, and there is evil lurking in her.<PF>The other is that she is being controlled by a monster.<PF>She's probably coming back to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Meteor Pit</FONT> around now.

Take care of it please
Which one?
You're saying that the monsters that snuck in here are seeking this evil artifact?  Hm, it seems like the situation is growing more complicated by the moment. <PF>For Thunder Hill and the whole world, I must make myself as harsh as I can be in order to exorcise the evil spirits...... <PF>I purified the evil artifact using the power of the heavens, so not only is it no longer evil,  but it has become a <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Holy Hormone</FONT> that is now able to purify monsters.  Take it with you!
There's nothing? That's weird, am I getting oversensitive?

Ahhh... What is this? It hurts... You traitor! I'll never forgive you... Hohoho... One of me has died... Still millions of others.. Did you think that destroying me would prevent this disaster?<PF>Hehehe... There are still many monsters hiding in the city! We may not be able to bomb it, but we still have many ways of destroying this place... Why don't you try finding them one by one... Hehehe... Ahhhhhh...
What are you doing here? Hurry up and get the Live Poison Hormone from the Zombie! He's probably in Spiritual Land. Now go!
So, did you find the pot?  Um, you were so forgetful, I cannot believe that you lost it!  Anyway, I have another one in my pocket, but I won't give it to you unless you have some space inside your backpack.

What's more, while he is severely short of manpower, he has to form a light infantry to put down monsters and maintain peace in the world. I hope you can go to <FONT COLOR#00ff00>the Ice Cave</FONT> to help <FONT COLOR#00ff00>Trott</FONT>.

Strategy Notice
<FONT COLOR#00ff00>Trott</FONT> hopes you can deliver the <FONT COLOR#00ff00>Strategy Notice</FONT> to <FONT COLOR#00ff00>Carline, Minyo and Shibly</FONT> in the deep Ice Cave.

Take the strategy notice to Shibly
Hurry and take the three <FONT COLOR#00ff00>Strategic Notes</FONT> to <FONT COLOR#00ff00>Carline, Minyo and Shibly</FONT>!
How are you! You come under the orders of Trott, right! Pass these words to the Sub-Head that.. no problem.. Tell him... not to worry about what.. has been assigned. I will accomplish it successfully..
Hey! Hello! Are you coming here...Hey! Hey! Hey!.. for something? If not, don't disrupt me.. Hey! Hey! Hey!.. to take the task.
In fact, Shibly is an honest guy. He's the most honest one among the light infantry! He likes to shout Hey! Hey! which makes him seem hard boiled, but.. it is funny. Ha-!
Take the strategy notice to Minyo
Hurry to take the three <FONT COLOR#00ff00>Strategic Notes</FONT> to <FONT COLOR#00ff00>Carline, Minyo and Shibly</FONT>!
Worm Princess...who are you? Worm Princess.. I want to go home. It is scary here. Worm Princess..  Has the Sub-Head assigned you to come? Worm Princess, no, there should be more tasks. Worm Princess.. I want to go home. Do you know that the monsters here are very scary. Worm Princess, I met a semi-transparent person on the road, but the vice-head Carline doesn't believe me. Worm Princess.. Worm Princess, I really want to finish the tasks and go home.
Worm Princess! I want to go home. I don't want to perform any more tasks!
Minyo is timorous, even more timorous than a shy little girl. He is lachrymose and always seeks to run away from danger. He is like a little boy. I don't even know how he passed his initial examination. It is said that he can see things that others can't see. But perhaps his behavior outstrips his talent! If he doesn't improve his personality, he will not be too happy in the future.
Take the strategy notice to Carline
Hand over the Strategy Notice to Robell.
Hurry to take the three <FONT COLOR#00ff00>Strategic Notes</FONT> to <FONT COLOR#00ff00>Carline, Minyo and Shibly</FONT>!
It is you!? This is the strategy notice...? That's great. There is another task. Hahaha.. please pass it on to the Sub-Head that I will try my best. Ask him not to worry. Those awful monsters can wait a little longer to receive my administering of justice. I have been expecting this moment for a long time. Hahaha! Sub-Head, you have made me happy!
Stinky, get away from here, or I will kill you like those monsters. I have become tired of waiting.
Worm Princess.. I want to accomplish the tasks as soon as possible and go home.
Minyo is timorous, even more timorous than a shy little girl. He is lachrymose and always seeks to run away from danger. He is like a little boy. I don't even know how he passed his initial examination. It is said that he can see things that others can't see. But perhaps his behavior outstrips his talent! If he doesn't improve his personality, he will not be too happy in the future.
With regard to Carline.. to be honest, I don't like him all that much. He is strong and will not accept defeat. He rushes into action too often. However, he has merits as well. Because our Sub-Head Trott is so passive, when he is assigned to cooperate with Carline, we have performed well so far. Maybe Huai Yangtian knows this, and will make them into a team!
Strategic Notes have been delivered. Please return to Trott.
We.. good! Go have a rest! I will inform you if there are any tasks.
I have received the strategy notice! What are you doing here? Go back, or I will hit you with my fist, and send you flying to the moon.

Abnormal Tremor

Ask for Support
<FONT COLOR#00ff00>Trott</FONT> said that the ordinary weapons that are used <FONT COLOR#00ff00>wear down</FONT> severely, so there is a need for better equipment. The light infantry commander of Shengyun Cave has asked Uncle Dinwan to develop new weapons. How are they being developed? Please go to confirm <FONT COLOR#00ff00>how the new weapons are being developed</FONT> with vice-commander Guan Bozhi!

<FONT COLOR#00ff00>The vice commander Guan Bozhi</FONT>is good at distance shooting. When not engaged as the vice-commander, he took the crown in the light infantry shooting competition for 10 years straight. <FONT COLOR#00ff00>He was famed as </FONT>the Shooting King. Up until now, there has been no one who has been able to break his record. His shortcoming is that he is fond of telling old jokes. Ha-.
Are you coming to be a member of the light infantry..? Wait! I seem to have met you somewhere. You are famous everywhere in the Meteor Pit. Thanks to you, problems in all the regions can be solved successfully. The commander-in-chief says that if there were another 10 people like you, the monsters would be too scared and go back to their own world. Hahaha, please come in. You must have come here for something, right?
You said that we're in need of new weapons, right? Don't worry. Thanks for your help last time, <FONT COLOR#00ff00>Uncle Dinwan</FONT> was able to collect all the materials he needed, and so all the weapons could be produced on schedule. I was a little worried about asking someone to send them for me, and then you arrived. It seems to be fate. Ok.. please take them to Trott!
Look at your backpack! Is it full? Don't you think it's heavy? Haha! Go and clear it out come back to me!
You said that there is a need for new weapons in the Ice Cave, right? Don't worry, I have asked Uncle Dinwan to develop some new weapons which have never been used before. Because of the lack of help he nearly gave up, and he said that some key items couldn't be found. We don't even know how long he can prop them up. I was worried about asking someone to send them for me, and then you arrived. It seems to be fate. Ok, please take them to Trott!
Look at your backpack! Is it full? Don't you think it's heavy? Haha! Go and clear it out come back to me!
Get new weapons and return to Trott
You came back successfully. Good! Go have a rest!
Please go to <FONT COLOR#00ff00>San Joel</FONT> to <FONT COLOR#00ff00>seek the elder Yince</FONT>. Maybe he knows how to restore the seal.
Please give the new weapons to Trott right now! Wait! To speak candidly, I think you're a member of the light infantry from your head to your toes! Ah- that's to say, you're doomed to fight monsters everywhere your whole life! Don't be in a hurry to leave! Experience makes the man! If I am right, you'll be the next overlord of the light infantry. Come on! I have some books on Kung Fu. You can take each one for 20 yuan if you like..
Go to meet the Sub-Head to hand over the task! He has waited for you a long time!
Goods and materials hand-over
Dodonre has checked out a statement on all the new weapons, so I hope you can hand these over to Shibly, Minyo and Carline <FONT COLOR#00ff00>in the deep crystal cave</FONT>.

Give the new weapons to Shibly
Please give those <FONT COLOR#00ff00>new weapons</FONT> to <FONT COLOR#00ff00>Carline, Minyo and Shibly</FONT>!
Hey! Hello! You've come again! Hey! What are coming for today then! Hey! Those...Hey! Hey! Hey!.. are those new weapons! Hey! Hey! Hey!.. I get it! Please tell Sub-Head not to.. Hey!.. worry. I'll defend.. Hey! Hey! Hey!.. the underground three floors in the Ice Cave.. Hey! Hey! Hey!
Minyo is timorous, even more timorous than a shy little girl. He is lachrymose and always seeks to run away from danger. He is like a little boy.

If he doesn't improve his personality, he will not be too happy in the future.
In fact, a very important problem is that Shibly is a man who practices Taijutsu, so it is useless to give him those weapons, right? Will he take them to make holes in the ice? Haha, I really don't know what the Sub-Head will think of this. That's is just how I feel.
Give the new weapons to Minyo
Please give those <FONT COLOR#00ff00>new weapons</FONT> to <FONT COLOR#00ff00>Carline, Minyo and Shibly</FONT>!
Worm Princess.. Worm Princess.. you've come again? Worm Princess.. I know there is nothing good happening when I see you! Worm Princess... What's the matter then? Worm Princess, those, Worm Princess.. those weapons are so horrible, and so heavy! Worm Princess.. I don't want to go home, but I have picked a very beautiful gem, which gives out blue light. I will send this gem to the one I like, haha. However.. I have to get out of here earlier! Worm Princess!
Worm Princess! I want to go home. I don't want to perform any more tasks!
Hey! Hello! Hey! Hey! Hey! Please tell Sub-Head not to.. Hey!.. worry, I will defend.. Hey! Hey! Hey!.the three floors underground.. Hey! Hey!..
Word gets around, but the commander is so strange for putting together those problem people, the quiet Sub-Head, the excitable vice-commander, the timid vanguard and the inflexible nucleus. I really don't know what he is thinking. Maybe it is such a team that can achieve all that they have done. I hope the task can be achieved successfully.
Give the new weapons to Carline
Please give those <FONT COLOR#00ff00>new weapons</FONT> to <FONT COLOR#00ff00>Carline, Minyo and Shibly</FONT>!
Hahaha! I finally see the day when there come new weapons. With them, I will easily kill all those monsters here! Hahaha, you daredevil monsters, come to me if you have the guts, and I will cut you down! Come on! Come on! Hahaha-!
Stinky, get away from here, or I will kill you like those monsters. I have become tired of waiting.
Worm Princess.. I want to accomplish the tasks as soon as possible and go home.
Hey! Hello! Hey! Hey! Hey! Please tell Sub-Head not to.. Hey!.. worry, I will defend.. Hey! Hey! Hey..the three floors underground.. Hey! Hey!..
You should take those weapons to your companies in the deep cave quickly. What are you doing here? Although I don't much love anyone now, I don't want to be tied by a relationship. You help us frequently, and you come to chat with me, which I appreciate very much, and I know you are a good person, but.. I'm really sorry.
New weapons handover is complete. Please return to Trott
Er.. Good! Go have a rest! I will inform you if there are any tasks. (He is so apathetic and quiet as usual, and it makes a person so fed up)
I have received the strategy notice! What are you doing here? Go back, or I will kill you, and you will not see the sun tomorrow!

<FONT COLOR#00ff00>Bad-hearted Snowiers</FONT> in <FONT COLOR#00ff00>the three floors underground</FONT> are destroying the cave! Please go to clear them up
Look for ways to prevent them.
For the Snowiers sealed on the <FONT COLOR#00ff00>Devil Ice Mirror</FONT>, they seem to get weaker as the power of the seal gets weak, making a great number of Snowiers gather. Although the newly-made weapons can defeat these monsters successfully, the Snowiers are endless. Therefore, we have to suppress the power that make the Snowiers gather. Therefore Dodonore asks you to find a <FONT COLOR#00ff00>machinist</FONT> called <FONT COLOR#00ff00>Kalgof</FONT> <FONT COLOR#00ff00>in San Joel</FONT>, who does research especially in weapons of swiftness. I hope you can bring me good news. Because.. <FONT COLOR#00ff00>Kalgof</FONT> is hard to deal with.

Stinky! Don't disturb me!
Are you Ze Zaiwa?
What are you so sinister for?
How can you call my name directly!!! You, ignorant stinky.. go away!! Don't disturb me!
Then...are you Mr. Ze?
There so many strange guys!
That's good. What do you want? If you have just come to see my inventions, you can go back now. I only let those who know how to appreciate my inventions view them.. for example <FONT COLOR#00ff00>the headmaster of Spirit School</FONT>. If you have come to ask me to make something, you may as well go back where you came from, because you cannot afford to employ me. Unless you ask me to do something I'm interested in.. but I doubt you could think of any good ideas!
What ideas will you accept?
How much cash do you need?
Good question! I never make ordinary things, unless I think they are challenging. Don't take me for an ordinary blacksmith. Is that clear?
I saved the Ice Cave!!!
You are such a strange guy!
It is a little bit.. difficult. You know that. I just made fun of you then! However, I know about the things you refer to in general. I used to be asked similar questions, but I cannot remember who asked me. You are lucky today, in fact, because I have agreed to do research on them. But I have no time to collect the materials that I need. As long as you help me to collect <FONT COLOR#00ff00>Mandala pearls, Arctic Kouga and degenerated bones</FONT>, then I should be able to produce them.
Am I strange? You are not the first one to say so. You can go if you don't like me. I am very busy!
Do you seek to make use of my skills? It will cost you a fairly high price. You have to pay <FONT COLOR#00ff00>1000000 golden coins</FONT> to produce one thing. Do you have enough money? Are you willing to pay?
Go ahead!
What are you doing here?
Then I won't be so easy to accept. Come back to me later, and I will prepare it for you. Do not worry, I won't take your money and run.
Haha! Are you sure you have that much money? Hahaha.
I guessed that you would not be willing to pay!
If you think I'm strange you can find someone else to make them for you!
Then don't come to disturb me!
Go to <FONT COLOR#00ff00>San Joel</FONT> to seek out <FONT COLOR#00ff00>Ze Zaiwa</FONT>, in order to find a way to stop the cave from being destroyed.

Holla...holla...! will you just take these items now? Go and check your backpack. Do you think you can take them? Hmmm! You are such a pixie.
What are you doing here? Why don't you collect them right now! I need a <FONT COLOR#00ff00>Mandala pearl, Arctic Kouga and Degenerated bone</FONT>. Don't forget.. you pixie!
You really disappoint me. Don't you know that a real adventurer figures out solutions by himself? I can't take you for a real adventurer. <FONT COLOR#00ff00>Mandala pearls and Arctic Kouga can be obtained from the magic flower Mandala and Arctic Werewolf</FONT> on the Ginkotsu Snowfield, <FONT COLOR#00ff00>while degenerated bones can be obtained from</FONT> the degenerated child on the Magic mirror icefield. If you cannot make it, then go home and drink warm milk!
Unexpectedly.. You've engaged me! Hahaha, remember to come back to me next time. Here you are! These are the items you need.
You cannot take them away even if you pay! Go and check your backpack. It is full. Will you take them away? You underestimate things!
Get the Fire Energy Stone and return to Trott
Is this called <FONT COLOR#00ff00>Fire Energy Stone</FONT>? It does indeed give out warmth and is full of energy. Thank you, you go have a rest! I will give you another task later.

Worm Princess.. who are you? You can't be the girl who just talked to me! Worm Princess..  I tell you, just now there is a girl who came here to ask for help from me, saying that she is disappearing, but when I told this to the vice-commander, he dismissed me! He told me not to manufacture false stories because I was eager to go home. But I didn't lie to anybody! Worm Princess.. If you don't believe me, <FONT COLOR#00ff00>you can go to the second floor underground</FONT> to find the girl. I saw her there just now. She looked very young.  Is this what the Sub-Head asked to be brought here? I got it. I really wish the task can be done as soon as possible. Worm Princess, I can't bear this place anymore!
Worm Princess! I want to go home. I don't want to perform any more tasks!

Come to visit me. I feel so bored. Sub-Head does not chat with me, and all I can do is just stand here, feeling so bored. Just now there seemed to be someone pulling my coat, but I saw nobody. How strange. Could it be that there exists.. a ghost? Forget it.. this world is full of monsters and ghosts. It's all good as long as they don't peep at me in the shower!

I haven't seen you for a long time. Have you been scared away? Hahaha..! Did you go home to change your diaper?!     Are there new things! Is this a Fire Energy Stone? What is it? Hmmm, I don't need that. What I need is just a weapon, and then I will be able to sort out those monsters.. none of whom could stop me. However, because the Sub-Head has asked you to bring this to me, put it down there. I still won't use it though!   Minyo is almost cracking up. He always said that there were ghosts. I feel very strange. There are so many ghosts and monsters. That is, if you've seen them. Hasn't he seen any monsters on the way here? I am fed up with him. He should pick a better excuse for giving up! Hum-.
Stinky! Get away from here, or I will kill you like a monster. I am fed up with waiting... plus, Minyo is making a racket here. I'm going to lose it.
Worm Princess.. I want to accomplish our tasks and go home! Have you gone to seek the little girl? I won't lie to you!

I really miss the charge nurse in the far Meteor Pit. I hope the charge nurse can take care of herself while she's taking care of the others.    Can I ask for help from you? This is the gem I picked up here. I think it is very, very beautiful and I want to take it to the charge nurse.. because she always takes such good care of me. If it is possible, could you take the gem to the charge nurse for me? Thank you very much.
I'm sorry, my backpack is full. Please clear it up. If you are willing to help me, I will appreciate you very much.
Please take this gem to <FONT COLOR#00ff00>the charge nurse Feiyue</FONT>! Thank you.
Thanks for your help. Thank you. However, please accomplish the task that the Sub-Head gave to you. I am so sorry that you have spent so much time on me. Haha.
The gem is beautiful. You said this is what Tinly asked you to give me? Thank you for bringing it to me, and please tell Tinly that I worry about her very much. and that I hope she can accomplish her tasks successfully.. as do I, Fendiya. In order for the light infantry to recognize their abilities. Some members fail to understand that if I give them special privileges, it is because I require more from them than I do from others. Thank you!
Please go back to meet Tinly. Thank you for coming!
Go to seek the mystery girl
Have you found the Ice Magic Mirror?

Please accomplish the task that the Sub-Head gave you. I am so sorry that you have spent so much time on me. Haha.
Can.. can you see me?
Yes!
I can see nothing.
That's great! I finally meet someone who is able to see me. I'm <FONT COLOR#00ff00>Mino</FONT>, but this is not my body. My body is in the deep Ice Cave. In order to seal the powerful monsters in my body, my body is sealed in the deep bottom of the cave. However, recently, I feel a nameless force dragging me, which makes my power weaker and weaker, because I have to suppress the monsters in my body, and in addition counter the outside forces.   Fortunately, there comes a group of people, who constantly kill those monsters, restoring my power little by little, but overall it still gets weaker and weaker. You are the first one who has wanted to talk with me. I met a young man before, but he seemed to fear me, so I could not ask help from him.   In fact, I have been there for hundreds of years, and my power has been getting weaker since about fifty or sixty years ago. Recently, I nearly cannot suppress the monsters hiding in my body, resulting in the leak of devilish forces, which attract more and more monsters here. Therefore, this has become the place where monsters are gathering. The situation gets worse. Since you can see me and are willing to talk with me, you must be the hero to come and save me.   I hope you can help me to find a way to restore my power.. please. By the way, I want to remind you that this body is what I was made into according to mankind. I supposed it would let me be closer to you in the beginning, but not ultimately. I was then named by them as <FONT COLOR#00ff00>Ice Magic Mirror</FONT>. Although I don't like it, it should be helpful for you to find a way to save me.   Well, there is a very hot force in your body which presses on me. Are you carrying something full of energy? I have never felt such a kind feeling before. Comparatively speaking, the devilish forces seem to be getting weaker. If you carry such an item, please don't bring it when you come back to me next time, because it makes me sad. I'm sorry.
Alas, why do you think that I will help you? I also hope to find a brave soul who is willing to help me!
Accomplish tasks and return to Trott.
Have you found the Ice Magic Mirror?   (the talk continues. About 30 minutes later-)     So it is. Tinly has also told me that there was something dragging her. Maybe it is her! <FONT COLOR#00ff00>Mino</FONT> is <FONT COLOR#00ff00>the Ice Magic Mirror</FONT>. So I know. Let me think about what to do. Come back to me later. Give me some time to ponder.
Stinky! Get away from here, or I will kill you like a monster. I am fed up with waiting... plus, Minyo is making a racket here. I'm going to lose it.
Worm Princess...I want to accomplish the task and go home! Have you gone to seek that girl? Then you know I didn't lie to you! I will appeal to the commander that the vice-commander doesn't trust me.
Hey! How are you! You come under the orders of Trott, right! Hey!! Pass these words to the Sub-Head that.. Hey! Hey! Hey!.. no problem.. Hey! Hey! Hey!.. Tell him... Hey!.. not to worry about what.. Hey! Hey! Hey!.. has been assigned. I will accomplish it successfully.. Hey! Hey! Hey!..
Thank you! You've been running around! Do your legs feel sore? If they do, take a rest! I may never ask you to drink tea in the future!
Thanks for all those things I asked you to help with. I don't know how long I can sustain myself. If the monsters come back, it will be too late.
Restore the way of sealing
In order to restore the power of the Ice Magic Mirror <FONT COLOR#00ff00>Trott</FONT> suggests you to go to <FONT COLOR#00ff00>San Joel</FONT> to find an elder called <FONT COLOR#00ff00>Yin Ce</FONT> who is knowledgeable. Maybe he is able to find a way to restore the power of sealing.
EXP x 50000, money x 500
Go to San Joel to seek Yin Ce
Please go to <FONT COLOR#00ff00>San Joel</FONT> to <FONT COLOR#00ff00>seek the elder Yince</FONT>. Maybe he knows how to restore the seal.
Are you coming for something, young man? Cough-cough...
I want to ask something.
You look so sick.
(30 minutes pass after he tells the elder what he has come here for-)   I know something abut the Ice Magic Mirror! It was something during the days of my great, great, great grandfather. Unexpectedly, there is someone who reminds me of it. Please wait for me a while here. I'm going to look up general information-.  (Time flies-about 3 hours later-)   I finally found it. Let me see what it says. <FONT COLOR#00ff00></FONT> Let me think over what it means.. I remember the ground-fathers have left some other information.. Wait for me a while. (Time flies-about 1 hour later-)   I get it. Freezing.. should mean the Ice Cave. That should be the <FONT COLOR#00ff00>Ice Cave</FONT>. Then the whole sentence means As soon as the seal of the Ice Magic Mirror disappears, the Ice Cave will be destroyed, and the monsters will be revived. What we need is the <FONT COLOR#00ff00>xuanbing Jadedew</FONT> to restore the power of the seal. However, we first need <FONT COLOR#00ff00>Brilliant Devil Stones, Brilliant Crystallizations and Brilliant Crystals</FONT> so that xuanbing Jakedew <FONT COLOR#00ff00>is able to be extracted</FONT>. As for how to save lives in this world, it is just a decision of how we make it. It should be exactly right. So, if you want to restore the power of the seal, you have to get <FONT COLOR#00ff00>xuanbing Jadedew</FONT>, for which <FONT COLOR#00ff00>you</FONT> need <FONT COLOR#00ff00>Brilliant Devil Stones, Brilliant Crystallizations and Brilliant Crystals to make it with</FONT>. Then I have to trouble you to get these three items. It is impossible to ask me, an old man, to collect them! Cough-cough!
Are you coming for something, young man? Cough-cough...
Go to get materials for xuanbing Jadedew
Please go to <FONT COLOR#00ff00>San Joel</FONT> to <FONT COLOR#00ff00>seek the elder Yince</FONT>. Maybe he knows how to restore the seal.
You have collected them and come back. Thanks. It must have been difficult to collect them. Cough-cough. Please have a rest here! I will begin to extract them. During the time you went to collect the materials, I got an idea how to make them. Please wait for me a while!     (Time flies-6 hours later-)    You must have waited for a long time. This is the <FONT COLOR#00ff00>xuanbing Jadedew</FONT>. It is indeed full of power. I feel that my heart almost begins to be washed by it. Take it away right now! I guess the power of the seal is getting weaker gradually!    By the way, remember to absorb energies in the cave with the xuanbing Jakedew at first. Now, it has little energy. When it is full of energy, it will give out a holy light. I hope you can accomplish the task successfully this time.
You backpack is full. Go to clear it up!
Go to collect <FONT COLOR#00ff00>Brilliant Devil Stones, Brilliant Crystallizations and Brilliant Crystals</FONT>! It is recorded in the book <FONT COLOR#00ff00>that Brilliant Devil Stones, Brilliant Crystallizations</FONT> <FONT COLOR#00ff00>can be obtained on</FONT> the third floor of the Ice Cave, while the <FONT COLOR#00ff00>Brilliant Crystals</FONT> can be found on the <FONT COLOR#00ff00>fourth floor</FONT>, because people cannot distinguish minerals with their eyes. Monsters, however, will be attracted by the power of the minerals, so you can make it past the monsters in this district. Go collect them!
Accomplish tasks and return to Trott.
This is the item that is able to restore the power of the seal! Surely enough, you can feel the strong energy. Give <FONT COLOR#00ff00>the xuanbing Jadedew</FONT> to me. I will let it be full of energy. You, go have a rest, for you have worked so hard recently!
Have you found a way to restore the power of the seal?
Take it to the Ice Cave quickly! I guess the power of the seal is getting weak!
Seal's blessing
<FONT COLOR#00ff00>Xuanbing Jadedew</FONT> has absorbed all the energy. <FONT COLOR#00ff00>Trott</FONT> thinks it can be taken to the  <FONT COLOR#00ff00>Ice Magic Mirror</FONT>. I hope you can go to the place where the <FONT COLOR#00ff00>Ice Magic Mirror is</FONT> to help restore the power of the seal.
Exp x 100000, money x 1000, special reward x 1
Go and help to restore the seal
Please go to <FONT COLOR#00ff00>help the Ice Magic Mirror</FONT> to restore her power!
You've finally come. I can hardly make it any more..  Please give me the item you have brought for me.    Gulugulu-    It is.. ? Thank you. I am beginning to fill with energy.. and endless energy is coming to me. Now I am finally able to feel where the powerful forces outside are coming from. For a long time, I looked for the source of the evil spirit around the cave, but because my power had weakened gradually, I could not make it out.  Now I know where it is from <FONT COLOR#00ff00>the Executioner</FONT> on <FONT COLOR#00ff00>the fourth floor underground</FONT>, I hope you can go to kill him. Otherwise, I cannot focus on suppressing the monsters in my body. Thank you.
I.. I almost can't make it. Have you brought me the items?
Go to kill the Executioner

Please go to <FONT COLOR#00ff00>help the Ice Magic Mirror</FONT> to restore her power!

Sorry, please clear your backpack. I hope I can express my thanks to you.
I hope you can go and kill <FONT COLOR#00ff00>the Executioner for me</FONT>, or I cannot suppress the monsters in my body. Thank you.
Accomplish tasks and return to Trott.
Thank you. Until just now, I could not feel the evil spirits that were supposed to be strong and evil, then I knew you had already accomplished the tasks successfully. Thank you for your help. Without you, I think we, such a small team, would be killed sooner or later. I wish to call you <FONT COLOR#00ff00>Crystal Hero</FONT>. We will pay tribute to you with this name. Thank you.   It is a great pleasure to meet you. It would be a great gain for me to take this task. I hope one day I can express my appreciation to you, little hero. The hero of our ice team. Thank you. If the Ice Cave is attacked by devil spirits again in the future, we hope you can help us again. Thank you.     Leave the rest of the work to us, so that we will feel less guilty. I will report to the superiors about you. Thank you.
Oh, please go to clear your backpack up! I want to present you with something.

Go to Hira
For the <FONT COLOR#00ff00>power of the seal in Inferno Castle</FONT> gets weaker. <FONT COLOR#00ff00>And so, the prophet Zhuho</FONT> dispatches <FONT COLOR#00ff00>Sunson</FONT> to go to Inferno Castle to seek out the reason why the power of the seal gets weak, and to restore its power. However, it has been a long time passing, and recently the prophet Zhuho has some other things to tell Sunson. But there is no response from him. So, <FONT COLOR#00ff00>Fei Lei</FONT> hopes you can go to <FONT COLOR#00ff00>Inferno Castle</FONT> to seek <FONT COLOR#00ff00>Sunson</FONT>, and bring <FONT COLOR#00ff00>Zhuho's manufacture</FONT> to <FONT COLOR#00ff00>him</FONT>. If he asks for help, you should assist him.

It is rather dangerous here. I don't know why the monsters here are affected by the power of seal that was set in place by our Secret Cult. They tend to be more powerful than those in other places. It's confusing.
Are you Sunson?
It is really dangerous.
Yes, I am.. What have you come for?   This was made by the prophet Zhuho.. er. I know. Thanks for coming. It has clearly been recorded on the manufacture that I should give you something as a present. However, I am sorry.. there is nothing that cherished close at hand right now. This is a little gift. Please take it.
That's good if you know that. Please go away quickly.

Explore evil spirit
The power of the seal is getting weaker in Inferno Castle, and many evil spirits are beginning to move. At present there is a group of evil spirits from the <FONT COLOR#00ff00>Heavenly Dog of the Crow</FONT> in <FONT COLOR#00ff00>Inferno Castle 1F of Hira</FONT>. I hope you can go to investigate those evil spirits and kill them. Before that, please go to get the <FONT COLOR#00ff00>Jar of Purification</FONT> from the <FONT COLOR#00ff00>Yulian</FONT>! Only with the Jar of Purification can we suppress those evil spirits.

Hira's Bullhorn
Due to fighting with the escaping evil spirits, Sunson and others are very tired. It is estimated that they cannot stick to it for another month. Then, they must ask to withdraw. If they have <FONT COLOR#00ff00>the Hira's Bullhorn</FONT>, perhaps other methods may be available, so Yuhe asks you to go to <FONT COLOR#00ff00>Thunderlingt Shuili</FONT> to <FONT COLOR#00ff00>find the</FONT> <FONT COLOR#00ff00>Northroad servant leader Fanrisy</FONT> for the Hira's Bullhorn.

Hello, I'm <FONT COLOR#00ff00>Northroad servant leader Fanrisy</FONT>. Are you coming here for something please? If you want to be a member of our <FONT COLOR#00ff00>Heaven's Union</FONT>, I'm sorry. If you are not one of the <FONT COLOR#00ff00>natural civilization</FONT> I cannot allow it. Is there something else I can do for you?
Im here for Hira's Bullhorn.
I will join Heaven's Union .
The Hira's Bullhorn? How do you know about it?    I see, it is <FONT COLOR#00ff00>Yuhe</FONT> who meets difficulties <FONT COLOR#00ff00>when performing tasks</FONT> in Hira. The Hira's Bullhorn are not supposed to be <FONT COLOR#00ff00>given to others</FONT> easily, because information about the structure of Hira and monsters in it are recorded on it.  However, I really admire the intelligence of our forefathers, because <FONT COLOR#00ff00>only those who have had baptisms</FONT> can read the information, and ordinary people cannot. If people with evil spirits try to read it forcibly, the Hira's Bullhorn will be destroyed in a flash. Therefore, I am not afraid for to take it away. This is the Book. Please give it <FONT COLOR#00ff00>to Yuhe</FONT> and remember not to let it fall into enemy hands.
This is the Hira's Bullhorn. It is either too big or small, but your backpack is full. It is a little bit difficult to put it into your bag. Please clear your bag out.
I am very glad you are willing to be one of our Heaven's Union. However, I'm sorry.. we've enrolled enough this year. You'll have to come next year. I'm sorry.
Give the Hira's Bullhorn to Yuhe
Please give it <FONT COLOR#00ff00>to Yuhe</FONT> and remember not to let it fall into the hands of enemies.
That's great! Thanks for bringing this Book to me. You didn't peep into it, right? It doesn't matter. You cannot read information in it anyway. Thanks again. And so.. we can explore methods to seal Inferno Castle.

I am protecting Inferno Castle...
You are so handsome!
Inferno Castle? Have you been commissioned by <FONT COLOR#00ff00>the two sisters</FONT> Yuhe and Yulian? One of the two girls is smart while the other one is confused. The younger sister, Yuhe, is smart and her magic power is just above average, but her confused elder sister bears a strong magic power, which is almost more powerful than that of <FONT COLOR#00ff00>Northroad servant leader Fanrisy</FONT>.   Speak up! What do you need from me?
I'm coming for the Seal Stone
They said you are handsome.
<FONT COLOR#00ff00>Seal Stone</FONT>? You should have already read the <FONT COLOR#00ff00>Hira's Bullhorn</FONT>. In fact I have already started to make a <FONT COLOR#00ff00>Seal Stone</FONT>. Due to the expectation that it will be needed quickly. The fact is, a lot of complex materials are needed. Although I have dispatched a lot of people to collect them, there are still some things lacking. If it is possible, can you go forth to seek <FONT COLOR#00ff00>the Wing of Morningdew</FONT>. It is recorded that it can be obtained from <FONT COLOR#00ff00>the seclusion monster</FONT> <FONT COLOR#00ff00>on the fourth floor of the Mystery cave.</FONT> <FONT COLOR#00ff00>Thanks for</FONT> collecting the Wing of Morningdew.
Come on. I know I am handsome. I am reminded of this everyday. However, things cannot be done automatically just because of my handsome appearance. Speak up!
Thank you. Please don't disturb me if you don't have something to do here.

You have performed so successfully. That's great. However, there is both good and bad news. The people I dispatched to <FONT COLOR#00ff00>the third floor of the Depth School</FONT> to seek <FONT COLOR#00ff00>the Blue Stone</FONT>, were defeated by the <FONT COLOR#00ff00>Soul Knight Dullahan</FONT>. Thus, I have to give you the task of finding <FONT COLOR#00ff00>the Blue Stone</FONT>. It is said that <FONT COLOR#00ff00>Soul Knight Dullahan has a brilliant gem</FONT>, that is known as the <FONT COLOR#00ff00>Blue Stone</FONT>. I hope you can get it successfully.
It is recorded in the ancient book that <FONT COLOR#00ff00>the Blue Stone</FONT>can be obtained from<FONT COLOR#00ff00></FONT> the seclusion monster<FONT COLOR#00ff00></FONT> on the fourth floor of the Mystery cave. Thank you.

I really should have asked you earlier, but the materials for the Seal Stone could be collected already. Since you have taken the tasks before, I want to give you a hard task, and in fact a very important item. To restore the seal in Inferno Castle, evil items around Inferno Castle are needed so that their evil spirits can be conciliated efficiently.  I have been researching the evil spirit around Inferno Castle that is the most powerful and stable. It is the <FONT COLOR#00ff00>Hell Knight</FONT>. However, at present we of the Heaven's Union and the Prophet Council have united together to station there, so we can spare no extra effort to collect the final item. I have dispatched a lot of people there, but it cannot be achieved. You have collected so many items, and it demonstrates that you have excellent capabilities. Maybe only you can get the final item.  I have talked too much. You do not want to hear me talk so much rubbish, right? So the final material is <FONT COLOR#00ff00>the Dazzling Blood</FONT> <FONT COLOR#00ff00>of the</FONT> the Heal knights <FONT COLOR#00ff00></FONT>. I hope you can collect it successfully this time.
It is said that <FONT COLOR#00ff00>Soul Knight Dullahan has a brilliant gem</FONT>, that is known as the <FONT COLOR#00ff00>Blue Stone</FONT>. <FONT COLOR#00ff00>Soul Knight Dullahan</FONT> is located on <FONT COLOR#00ff00>the third floor beneath the Depth School</FONT>. I hope you can get it successfully..

That's great! Now I can make the Seal Stone. Please wait for me a while here!   (10 minutes pass...)    (20 minutes pass...)      (30 minutes pass...)      (60 minutes pass...)   Haha, it's done. Brave one. This is <FONT COLOR#00ff00>the Seal Stone</FONT>! Please take it! We are counting on you for the seal Hira!
Come on! Young man. You are embarrassing me. There is little room here in your bag. How can I give you the Seal Stone? Is that right?
<FONT COLOR#00ff00>The Dazzling Blood</FONT> of <FONT COLOR#00ff00>Hell Knights</FONT> on <FONT COLOR#00ff00>Arctic Tundra</FONT> is the last material we need. I have also asked you to accomplish and collect this material.
Get the Seal Stone and return to Yuhe
You are back! I thought you ran away. I was thinking you were an irresponsible guy. Unexpectedly, you have accomplished the task of getting the Seal Stone back. Now we can go on to the next stage. Go have a rest. come back to me later, and we will discuss the next task.

Start to seal
We can go on sealing, and getting the Seal Stone. We have to give the Seal Stone to <FONT COLOR#00ff00>Yuanmy and Shenzoo</FONT>. What's more, we have to make an exchange of the <FONT COLOR#00ff00>Seal Stones on the seal pillar of the southeast room in Erchong of Hira</FONT> and <FONT COLOR#00ff00>the Keep northwest room in Inferno Castle</FONT>.

I saw the knife on the floor. I have picked it up. Here you go.
So.. Sobig, even if your backpack is full, please don't throw my knife away!
Worm Princess, my love. I hate myself that I am not able to save you. Ah! If you leave me, I will die of heartbreak.... ah! <FONT COLOR#00ff00>Worm Princess</FONT> my love.. Well? Is the knife in your hand... the one Poligang likes most?  A-ha, that little boy is willing to give it to you... you must be very great,  so that the little boy will be sincerely convinced!
Thank you
No, <FONT COLOR#00ff00>I know Poligang</FONT> well. He will never take ordinary people into his eyes. You must be wonderful, then he will trust you. In fact, I was supposed to try my best to save my love <FONT COLOR#00ff00>Worm Princess</FONT>, but the Sheikh dislikes him because of his disobedience  and he dispatches a lot of people to seek me. So I cannot make this scene. So, please have mercy and help me!
I am incumbent on it
But I am really not free
Worm Princess! This is the first since I began my abscondence. Brave one, thank you very much.   <FONT COLOR#00ff00>After Worm Princess was</FONT> picked as the holy girl, she was stored <FONT COLOR#00ff00>by the shamans, Meryote</FONT> in our group!  I don't know where she is at all. However the guard who escort holy girls must know <FONT COLOR#00ff00>where Worm Princess</FONT> is. They are the guards in <FONT COLOR#00ff00>Wizard's Cave</FONT> at the mean time. You can Go find them and beat around the bush  If you can get the information <FONT COLOR#00ff00>where Worm Princess</FONT> is, remember to tell me. Then I will keep <FONT COLOR#00ff00>the knife of Poligang</FONT>.
Alas! The God is not beneficent, nor is mankind. You go..
Who are you? If you have nothing to do, please go right now. Don't disturb me, missing <FONT COLOR#00ff00>Worm Princess here</FONT>.
To find the guard of Wizard's Cave Snachili
You go to <FONT COLOR#00ff00>the Wizard's Cave</FONT> to find the guard and beat around the bush  If you can get the information about <FONT COLOR#00ff00>where Worm Princess</FONT> is, remember to tell me!
The holy girl is rather excellent. It is said that she bears great power, which can be seen on a summer's day. So we hope the Yanling Okami can obtain her power in full range  in order to help us enhance the seal, and purify the spiritual power in Shizhen.
You are so selfish
You darn pixie, dare fling off a remark! It would be nothing to sacrifice you to save all of mankind.   If you are so capable, go to knockdown the big devil  and give peace to us all, but do not quarrel with me here.
What will you do then?
Oh- sorry!
You! Did you take it seriously? Ha, if you.. can get out of <FONT COLOR#00ff00>River Plains</FONT> you should laugh in your beard. How dare you have a vain hope of knocking down the big devil! However, if you continue to show off your skills, I will not stop you. Those child ghosts loafing about on the plain are actually <FONT COLOR#ffad5b>guards from Yanling Okima</FONT> to welcome the holy girl. If you are capable, go to pull <FONT COLOR#00ff00>the angles from Golden Ghost Child and Earth Ghost Child</FONT>!  Remember to <FONT COLOR#00ff00>take one angle respectively from the Golden Ghost Child</FONT>, <FONT COLOR#00ff00>and Earth Ghost Child</FONT>! Hahaha!
No problem!
Let me consider a while
You! You took it seriously! Remember to bring me one angle from respectively <FONT COLOR#00ff00>the Golden Ghost and Earth Ghost</FONT>! Hahaha!
What do you think? Then you know I am so excellent! I knew early on that you could not make it- haha!
It's fine if you know. Get away if you don't have anything important. Don't disturb me!

You.. you can even catch my sword and then break it off.. You are capable!  I am a fighting match for you! But you should be responsible for your behavior.
Of course I will
How wildly arrogant you are. I will report you to <FONT COLOR#00ff00>the wizard Meryote</FONT>,  and ask him to teach you a lesson. Don't go unless you are bold.
Where is the holy girl?
Hmph! I will not tell you..!  It hurts! Ok, ok, ok, I'll tell you, I'll tell you. The holy girl has been sent to <FONT COLOR#00ff00>the sacrificial altar of</FONT> the River Plains. I warn you not to take it for granted that you can defeat Yanling Okima <FONT COLOR#ffad5b>, even if you have defeated the ghost child</FONT>!
What is it
I am so scared
You foolish man, you look down upon <FONT COLOR#ffad5b>Yanling Okima</FONT>! Ok, if you want to die, go for it!  I have warned you! Don't bring us trouble because of your crazy behavior, or we will never let you go!
That's fine if you feel scared. Don't ask for any information if you don't want it. If you offend the <FONT COLOR#ffad5b>Rock Spirit</FONT>, and bring us big trouble. we will never let you off!
How do you feel? Do you know of the difficulties? Haha, I knew you could not make it.
Go to Crystal Room to return to Layte
What do you want me for? Don't search for information anymore! Go back!!!
I have been waiting for you so long! How about it? Have you gotten the information about <FONT COLOR#00ff00>where the</FONT> Worm Princess is?
You mean she is on her way to be sacrificed?.. Oh, my God!  How could you be so cruel to me, to separate my great love from me by death?  If she dies, how could I live alone?  Oh, God! No!!!
Don't worry. You have me.
Alas! I do think so
Really? Do you really want to save my unfortunate <FONT COLOR#00ff00>Worm Princess</FONT>?  But she now falls in the hands of <FONT COLOR#ffad5b>Yanling Okima</FONT>!  I don't know whether she is alive or not.. anyhow. please help me to seek her. If she is alive, please rescue her; If she is dead, please send me a message. I will practice magic arts here and call for her soul to come back. It is said that Yanling Okima is neither good nor bad. He is only responsible for enhancing the seal <FONT COLOR#00ff00>on the River Plains</FONT>;  So to get great power to repair the seal, <FONT COLOR#ffad5b>Yanling Okima</FONT> will do everything by fair means or foul, even by killing the lives of innocent girls! It is said that <FONT COLOR#ffad5b>Yanling Okima</FONT> is of tortoise green skin  with a patch on the right eye and a mouth of steel teeth. <FONT COLOR#00ff00>And there is the word Big</FONT>on the file cloth! He appears <FONT COLOR#00ff00>in Shizhen plain</FONT> often. Wu Meifei <FONT COLOR#00ff00>is believed to</FONT> be there!

Ah? They, they are fake. Did you mean that you got it from the head of Kappas   They are fake. The real <FONT COLOR#ffad5b>Yanling Okima</FONT> is still alive.  Therefore I cannot leave, or I will bring trouble to all of you.. Worm Princess......!
I will save you
I had no idea then...
Worm Princess, I cannot wish to go back alive!  I just hope you can pass on this wisp of <FONT COLOR#00ff00>hair</FONT> to Layte, and ask <FONT COLOR#00ff00>him</FONT> not to forget me! Worm Princess..
Worm Princess, there is not enough room in your backpack!
Worm Princess, <FONT COLOR#00ff00>Layte</FONT>, how I wish I can see you again before I die, but these wild wishes will never come into being..
No, no, I cannot leave here now, or Yanling Okima will inflict punishment  unless.. Unless you can kill <FONT COLOR#ffad5b>him</FONT>, then you can rescue me. It is said that <FONT COLOR#ffad5b>Yanling Okima</FONT> would imitate ordinary monsters walking on the plain. As long as he imitates the other monsters, common people cannot distinguish him easily. We can only see the file cloth with the word Big to recognize him.

Please, don't give up all hope!
Things have been in this position. Please tell me what I can do now?  Good friend, those are all my savings for those years. Here you are. Please take it as the final thanks from me, this unfortunate man.
No...- I don't believe you! You have no proof indicating that <FONT COLOR#00ff00>Worm Princess Meifei</FONT> will leave me! I don't believe you-

I have found the main culprit Meryote, but he said that the girl is to be sacrificed at her own volition. I intended to go to Worm Princess Meifei to ask her, but I found myself in a complicated love-tangle relationship.

Friend, you look terrible. You have undoubtedly come for an unkind purpose. We could make things clear and calm. Please don't fight.
Don't talk nonsense
I am just passing by..
Your forehead is black, and your lips are purple. This is an ominous look. Ha! You must be <FONT COLOR#00ff00>cursed by the</FONT> Town House Souls.  That's funny!
What are those damn things?
You are talking nonsense
<FONT COLOR#00ff00>The Town House Souls</FONT> are ghosts transformed from ancient houses of hundreds years past. Due to overpopulation, they couldn't make room for themselves, and were driven away <FONT COLOR#00ff00>by mankind</FONT>. Thus, they took the ancient houses as their own. <FONT COLOR#00ff00>Then, the Town House Souls</FONT> hated mankind very much. As soon as they would see a man, they would kill them immediately. You must have been to <FONT COLOR#00ff00>the River Plains</FONT>! They would have cursed you when you were off guard.
What should I do?
No feeling
Of course you have to kill those <FONT COLOR#00ff00>Town House Souls quickly</FONT>. Once they are killed, the curse on you will be released. <FONT COLOR#00ff00>The Town House Souls</FONT> have foul bodies overall. <FONT COLOR#00ff00>Kill five of them</FONT>, and the remaining two will never be a problem. Go now-
This is why the <FONT COLOR#00ff00>Town House Souls</FONT> are so scared. They will take a person's life subconsciously. If you don't go to kill them as soon as possible, even the gods cannot save you then!
Good medicine tastes bitter. Forget it. Forget it. You conduct yourself well.
That's great then. Please do it at your own accord.
Kill five Town House Souls and return to Meryote

Friend, you look full of spirit. You must have successfully killed the <FONT COLOR#00ff00>Town House Souls</FONT>, and cleared the curse!  You should thank me for helping you get out of such big trouble,  but you still look so unkind. It is obvious that you are not content with me. Is it out of the question concerning the holy girl, <FONT COLOR#00ff00>Worm Princess Meifei</FONT>?
Yes, it is.
No!
I know how your friend feels. It is indeed not humane to sacrifice a holy girl. I was not in favor of it either from the beginning, and have tried to stop it,  but holy girls of all ages are sacrificed at their own will. I have never forced them.
You are telling a lie.
How could it be?
It sounds ridiculous, but this is the truth. There is no need for me to lie to you. We used to sacrifice animals to <FONT COLOR#ffad5b>Yanling Okima</FONT>;  but ten years ago, a girl volunteered to sacrifice herself. As a result, that year <FONT COLOR#00ff00>monsters in the River Plains</FONT> reduced greatly and our spiritual power was purified slightly.  Because of this, the ugly custom of sacrificing girls came into being.
It sounds pretty ridiculous

Because of this, the ugly custom of sacrificing girls came into being.
I am totally confused now
I don't believe you
All people in the group are sure enough that this is my idea, but it is a secret of our group. Then I am complained about by all people. But I know that you come for <FONT COLOR#00ff00>Layte</FONT>, and because of that I have made an exception by telling you the truth. And so you can tell <FONT COLOR#00ff00>Layte</FONT> to drop the idea of using you for recourse! There is nothing more I can say-  Go back and tell him!
You have a prejudice against me. I have nothing to say. In that case, please go! I shan't help you anymore!

Oh, maybe I have offended you before. Please forgive me.
Friend, the unholy aura grows stronger and stronger. You should kill <FONT COLOR#00ff00>the Town House Souls</FONT>!
Alas! <FONT COLOR#00ff00>Worm Princess Meifei</FONT> my love, are you still in the wild fields alone?  How I wish I could fly to you and be with you, to die or to live!
Go to Crystal Room to return to Layte
I have nothing to say- Go back quickly <FONT COLOR#00ff00>to the Crystal Room</FONT> and tell him!
No, he is lying. Although the holy girls do it of their own will, <FONT COLOR#00ff00>Worm Princess Meifei</FONT> has told me herself that she was forced by the others. She loved me so much. How could she be willing to leave me to be sacrificed to Yanling Okima. Meryote is a liar. If you don't believe me, you can ask <FONT COLOR#00ff00>Worm Princess Meifei yourself</FONT> Ah.. ah! My love, <FONT COLOR#00ff00>Worm Princess Meifei</FONT>, are you still alive in this world? Friend, will you help me seek her?
I'll go right now
Well, it's troublesome..
According to our agreement, if she is still alive, please rescue her;  If she dies, please send me a message. I will practice magic arts here and call her soul back.
You have helped me so much. What can poor I do?
Go to River Plains and seek Worm Princess Meifei
<FONT COLOR#00ff00>Worm Princess Meifei</FONT> should be the one you meet on <FONT COLOR#00ff00>River Plains</FONT> - Go, quickly!
Yayaya! No, no, no!
What happened?
Are you hurt?
I had a <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Token of Love Ring</FONT> that <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Layte gave me</FONT>, but it was stolen by a <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Great Axe Sickle Weasel</FONT>! I beg you. Please give it back to me. If I die, I wish only to take the gift Layte gave me! I beg you... ...
No... ... but, Worm Princess... ...

Do you have any <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>information about</FONT> Worm Princess?
... ... Well? You have returned then... ... No, I mean that's great. I don't know how I can thank you! You took so many risks for us. Could it be that you... ... but I love <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Layte so much</FONT>. I can't... ... Oh, god. Why do you test me like this?
You think too much
... ...
You need not hide your true love for me. You cannot hide anything from my clear eyes. You don't have to say anything, just take this <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Token of Love Ring</FONT> and seek <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Layte</FONT>! If you dare to admit how you really feel, maybe I will reconsider... ...
You needn't say anything. My love for <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Layte</FONT> is deeper than the sea and harder than a rock. Don't try to test me anymore.
... ... Well? You indeed have returned... ... No, I mean that's great. But I really don't know why are you willing to take a risk for me so many times, Ah, I see. No wonder you want to fawn on Layte... ... But he is deeply in love with me. Your scheme is in vain... ...
You think too much.
Ok.
You don't have to hide your true feelings. You can hide nothing from my clear eyes. You don't need to say anything, Worm Princess! Give me the Token of Love Ring, and go back to seek <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Layte</FONT>! Tell him that I will fulfill your dream. Anyway, I will die soon. I will not argue with you, Worm Princess... ...
You don't have to say anything. I know how much the girls in my village love <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Layte</FONT>, I am dying, but you should be happy!
Haven't you found <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>the Token of Love Ring</FONT>? I beg you, this <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Token of Love Ring</FONT> is very important to me, please return it to me. Thank you!

Didn't I ask you to take the Token of Love Ring to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>the Crystal Room</FONT> and give it to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Layte</FONT>? Why are you leaving it here? Take it away!
Your backpack is full
Why... ... why? Why would my love Worm Princess return my Token of Love Ring? Could it be that you... ... you despicable person, you seduced her!
What are you bothering me for?
I have done nothing
Do you want to delay this any more? When I gave this ring to Worm Princess,  She told me that if one day she stopped loving me, she would ask her new lover to return it to me. Are you returning the ring to me now? Worm Princess... ... Worm Princess, my love, are you playing with me? Why is this guy carrying your Token of Love Ring?... Worm Princess!
You, explain it to me!
I am innocent
Forget it. You don't need to explain. Think about it, you are indeed a better man than me. It is you that risked your life to save and comfort her when she fell into the demon cave. You are not like me. I just hid here like a mouse. If I were Worm Princess , I would also choose to be with a man of such great power. Forget it! Take it! I know how to express my gratitude.
You don't need to explain it to me... ... Alas! Forget it. I cannot blame this on you. You are young and excellent, what's more you are handsome and you can move freely <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>on the River Plains</FONT>. But I cannot, and just like a mouse, I hide in a cave where I can't even see the sun. If I were Worm Princess, I would choose one who could be with me when I need help. Forget it! Take it! I know how to express my gratitude.
No, I don't believe you! You are an unconscionable scoundrel.
Why... ... why? Why would My love Worm Princess return the Token of Love Ring to me? Have you... ... done something, or told her something, <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>so that she</FONT> decided to break up with me?
What are you bothering me for?
I have done nothing
Do you wish to delay this any more? When I gave this ring to Worm Princess, she told me that if one day she stopped loving me, she would ask her new lover to return it to me. And so, are you returning the ring to me now? Worm Princess... ... Worm Princess, my love, are you joking with me? Why would my Token of Love Ring be carried here by this guy?... Worm Princess!
You, explain it to me!
I am innocent
I don't want to hear you say any more nonsense. So, it has come to this. I just want you to know that my whole life belongs to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Worm Princess</FONT>. I will never change my heart, even though you are young and beautiful. You cannot attract me. Now, what allows me to keep living is to avenge <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Worm Princess </FONT>... ... Forget it. Take this! I know how to thank you. Take this as my gift to you.
You don't have to explain yourself any more... ... It is impossible for me love you, even if <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Worm Princess </FONT> dies. I will remember her forever, and I will never forget her, so you'd best drop the idea forever! Even if you are beautiful and excellent, I will never change! I will take care of myself and practice Kung Fu in order to avenge Worm Princess, and then I will go to be with her... ... Forget it, Take this! I know how to thank you. Take this as my gift to you.
No, I don't believe you! You are such a person, with even less conscience than Meryote.
Have you any information about Worm Princess ?
Move through the first light
I used to think that the Holy Girl Worm Princess was sacrificed as an innocent, however <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>based on what I heard from Burrard the drunk</FONT> this seems unlikely. This whole thing just gets stranger and stranger. Maybe there is something hidden, unbeknownst to me.

Go to the entrance of the River Plains to meet with Mr and Mrs Lei
If you want to know the details, you can go to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>the entrance o fthe River Plains</FONT> to meet with <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Tolan and Susana</FONT>. They are waiting there.
Alas! I really can't understand why the shy and timid <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Worm Princess </FONT>  would be willing to become the Holy Girl? Alas! Alas!
Oh, Worm Princess! My son <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Layte</FONT>! My daughter in law <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Worm Princess</FONT>! Oh, Worm Princess.
Old lady, don't feel so bad
You make too much noise...
It was supposed to be such a happy thing. How could it come to this? <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Worm Princess</FONT>. I raised her like a daughter!  Finally, she was old enough to marry <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>my son Layte</FONT>, and then, suddenly, she disappeared. I was so worried about her that my hair started turning white. Who knew she would be foolish enough to let herself be sacrificed? <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Layte</FONT> acted without thinking, and now he is wanted for breaking our laws... ... Worm Princess, oh... . God, can you spare me and let my son and daughter return safely?
Your daughter is still alive
How are they alive?
What? Are you serious? Oh, I hope she comes back, but what would we do if <FONT COLOR=#ffad5b>we offended</FONT> Yanling Okima?  But I don't want her to die... ... she is such a sweet girl. I love her! When she disappeared, someone said that he had seen her at the Shizhen contour, and when she came back, she was acting strange. So, I think someone must have forced her to become the Holy Girl. Young man, can you investigate this for us?
No problem!
No
The man who saw <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Worm Princess</FONT> is a guy <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>living in Meteor Pit</FONT> called <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Burrard the Drunk</FONT>,  From his name, you can probably guess that he is a guy who spends a lot of time <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>in bars</FONT>. So, you can certainly find him <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>in the</FONT> bar <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>at Meteor Pit</FONT>!
... ... Worm Princess, oh.. I have such an unfortunate fate. It is said that the saddest things in life are to lose your father when you're a child, lose your partner in adulthood, and to lose your children when you're old... ... Oh, Worm Princess... If I lose both of them at the same time, I will go to be with them... ...
Shut up, you damn pixie! I don't speak with prunes! Go away! Worm Princess, oh... ...
Worm Princess, oh... Go away, you're too noisy! I am so sad...
Go to the bars in Meteor Pit to seek Burrard
If you want to know the details, you can go to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>the entrance of the River Plains</FONT> to meet with <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Tolan and Susana</FONT>. They are waiting there.
My wife said that there is a man called <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Burrard</FONT>, a drunk, who might know where my daughter in law <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Worm Princess</FONT> is.
Go to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>the bars</FONT> in <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Meteor Pit</FONT> to see <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Burrard</FONT>! He should know something!
Woo! Even though I was drunk... ... I still saw a lot! I saw that little Lei girl <FONT COLOR=#ffad5b>appear</FONT> at the Shizhen contour to the north of the River Plains. How could she just disappear? What's more, I also saw her with a beautiful girl all the time... ... Haha, the two looked like... .twins, it was so cute! What a pity, that such a beautiful girl would be willing to be sacrificed... ...
You just saw this?
Are you serious?
Of... .of course. I got a good look at them! After they finished talking, that beautiful girl, suddenly... ... went to talk with a corpse. <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>It was a Bronze Corpse</FONT>! I really don't know what she... ... woo! And then, she seemed to give the corpse something... ... Could it be that the beautiful girl... ... thought that the scared corpse could be bribed? Eh! But she... ... finally gave <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>the Bronze Corpse</FONT>... ... something. Maybe it was a love letter? Hahaha... ... I really want to know! What a pity! Except for drinking... ... I can't do anything. If you can find <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>the Bronze Corpse</FONT>, you could check it out... ... woo! So, off you go! Hahaha!
What do you mean, did I just see that?... ... Woo... ... I also saw a beautiful girl I didn't know, who unexpectedly... ... went to talk with a corpse. <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>It was a Bronze Corpse</FONT>! I really don't know how she... ... woo! And then, she seemed to give the corpse something... ... Maybe the beautiful girl... ... thought that those scary corpses could be bribed? Hah! But in the end she gave <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>the Bronze Corpse</FONT>... ... something?  Maybe it was a love letter? Hahaha... ... I really want to know! What a pity! Except for drinking... ... I can't do anything. If you can find <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>the Bronze Corpse</FONT>, you should check it out... ... woo! So, off you go, Hahaha!

Did the drunk <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Burrard</FONT> tell you anything?
You know where my daughter in law <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Worm Princess</FONT> is? Maybe you can go to the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>bars in Meteor Pit</FONT> to ask <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Burrard The Drunk</FONT>! He might know something!
Woo... ... e! This case is so beautiful, but it looks familiar. Mmmm... ... When I went to the Wan... ... .or some cave last time. I think I saw a wizard named Non... ... Do you know him? If you do, you can take him the case so he can have a look. Maybe he knows what this case is used for!
What a pity! Except for drinking... ... I can't do anything. Woo... Go defeat the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Bronze Corpse</FONT>! Hahaha!!
Go back to Wizard's Cave for Meryote
Is... ... is this the Life Blessing Jewel Box <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>that we lost</FONT>? Why do you have it? Wait, let me check. Uh-oh <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>this box</FONT> is a fake. This means that... ... No! The relic in the box, <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>the Life Blessing Pearl</FONT>, is lost!
Is it important?
It's none of my business... ...
Every shakti in his group delivers his remaining spiritual power to this pearl when he is dying, therefore the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Life Blessing Pearl</FONT> has a strong spiritual power, which is able to protect us from danger. Used by prophets in the Secret Cult, this box can be placed in <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Wizard's Cave</FONT>. It is taken out in the evening before the Holy Girl is sacrificed for her to use. Therefore, you should have guessed that the Holy Girl this time, <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Worm Princess</FONT>, must have taken advantage of the occasion and switched this with the real Life Blessing Jewel Box and took <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>the Deiming pearl</FONT>... ... You said that you took this box from monsters, right? Why would the Holy Girl do something like this? Could it be that she... ...
This sounds fairly serious.
The <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Life Blessing Pearl</FONT> has a strong, pure spiritual power. As soon as it fell into the hands of monsters, it would definitely have been poisoned and polluted by them. So the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Life Blessing Pearl</FONT> will become a very evil weapon, whose power could be used to destroy the boundary of the whole Shizhen! I must call a gathering to discuss how to resolve this issue. Friend, you have guts, and are excellent in fighting. I must ask you to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>return the</FONT> Life Blessing Pearl.
What should I do?
I don't want to have a finger in this pie
I just know that of all the monsters, <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>the Cave Spiders</FONT>, are used to deliver important items, because of their speed and hard hides. If my hunch it correct, the Life Blessing Pearl must be on their back. If you hurry to the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Cave Spiders</FONT>, perhaps there is still a chance to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>recover the</FONT> Life Blessing Pearl.
... ... I see. I believe you. This is important. I have to call the people into a group and discuss this with them. You can leave if you do not have any other questions.

It is a broken bottle... ... Wait, I sense the souls of my parents... ... No, did you kill them?
No! I just bottled them up
What? Please let their souls go! Souls cannot be separated from their bodies for too long, else they cannot return!
Please, tell me the truth.
What is the truth? I have no idea what you are talking about. Release my kind adopted parents. You, you... ... you'd better not go too far, or I will call on the Holy Girls who died before, <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>the spiritual Ghost</FONT> to teach you a lesson.
What? You can call on monsters?
You would really conspire with monsters?
I... ... this... ... forget it! Now that you know, I have nothing more to say. Yes, I am a member of a magical race that can call on monsters. I snuck into the human village when I was a child and pretended to be an ordinary girl in order to win their trust. The Yanling Okima is just something we <FONT COLOR=#ffad5b>made up.</FONT> It's not actually real. We did this just to steal a relic from the Shizhen group called <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>the Life Blessing Pearl</FONT> in order to destroy the boundary of Shizhen. We planned all of this, and sacrificed so many girls, just so this day would come, when I could become the Holy Girl so that I could have the chance to get the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Life Blessing Pearl</FONT>. Unfortunately, you foiled our plans too easily!
You cheated trusted people.
... ... I know that the members in Layte's family treated me well but I am the hierarch. I am also the younger sister of the Wumei Princess, Worm Princess. I cannot change the fact that I am a magical being. Even though all the members of the Lei family treated me well... ... I'm sorry, but I must sacrifice them to achieve my goal.
You love them, don't you?
You are so cruel.
... ... Shut up! I don't love them... ... I just... ... I just don't want to owe mankind any favors. Nor do I love <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Layte</FONT>. His death has nothing to do with me. Go back and tell <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Meryote</FONT> that <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Layte</FONT> had nothing to do with me. Please don't chase him anymore. <FONT COLOR=#00ff00></FONT>. I have told you the truth and given you the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Life Blessing Pearl</FONT>, so release <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>the souls of Tolan and Susana!</FONT>  If you don't release them soon, they can never return.
I see
In that case, don't talk aimlessly, and return their souls to their bodies. I will wait for you here. I will not leave. But I believe you, humankind can do nothing to me.  By the way, before you go, I want to tell you something about the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>spiritual Ghosts</FONT>. They were all the Holy Girls who were sacrificed in each age. They were tricked by us, and then became willing to become Holy Girls. Really, we tried to take good care of them, but they all wanted to escape, and then they were eaten by the monsters on the plain. Holy Girls were not meant to be treated like this, and so they transformed into <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Spiritual Ghosts</FONT> to wander the plain.
Is this true?
It's none of my business
... ... Yes, for they still have complaints, and they will not leave. To be honest, I feel sorry for them. I want you to save them. There are Cursed Stones in their <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>bodies</FONT>, As long as you can get <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>7 stones</FONT>, and give them to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Meryote</FONT> to be purified, it is believed they will transform into smiling Buddhas.
Mankind kills monsters, while we monsters kill you... ... This is a deadlock that will never be resolved.
Yes, I am such a bad woman. Anyway, I am a magical being, so you will never be fooled into believing that I have a human nature! Go away.
Why... ... why should you mock me? I have not done anything bad... ... Oh, it is you that forced me to break up with <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Layte</FONT> and now you force an imposition on me, You have gone too far! Oh...
Why... ... why do you look at me with eyes like that? I know what you are thinking, that it is useless for me to shout until my throat breaks in this wilderness!
What a strange feeling. I seem to have forgotten something??? Can I help you?
Do you still remember me, Mr.?
Nothing, nothing, I'm just passing by
Ah!!! I remember you! What have you done to... ... .to ... ... my wife?

Our poor innocent girls. To have been sacrificed like this. Those <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Cursed Stones</FONT> are formed from their complaints. Never mind. Let me purify these stones to disperse their complaints!
Take another two <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Revive Stones</FONT>. Take them, and touch <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>the bodies</FONT> of Tolan and Susana, and then <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>their</FONT> <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>souls</FONT> will be returned to their bodies. Thanks for your help this time. Thank you!   As for <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Layte</FONT>, I'm sorry, he has done something that is very much against the laws of our group. I cannot undo the charges against him, but I promise I will not issue any more. Please ask him to be careful.
Please clear some room <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>in your backpack</FONT> for me.
<FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Mr. and Mrs. Lei</FONT> should still be <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>lingering at the entrance of the River Plains</FONT>. How sad they are!
..................
..................
<FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Spiritual Ghosts</FONT> are wandering <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>in the district of the River Plains</FONT> in the southwest direction. There are many ghosts, but if you can save <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>seven of them</FONT> you will be incredible!
Do what you must! Return to me when you finish your task and we shall be square!
Release souls of Tolan and Susana
Alas, my darling girl <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Worm Princess</FONT>, you let us down. I feel so sad... ... If <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Layte</FONT> found out about it, how could he accept the truth? What's the matter? Why should my wife's soul cry in my body?
You stinky one!!! Never mind that you put our souls in the wrong bodies. You have to tell my son <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Layte</FONT> about this. He is in the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Crystal Room</FONT> now. Tell him not to worry.
You stinky one!!! Hurry and put my wife's soul back in her body.
..................
Oh, Worm Princess! I should have known all along! My poor girl <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Worm Princess</FONT>... ... is a magical being. We brought her up so devotedly and if <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Layte</FONT> found out, how sad he would be! Oh!? Why is my voice so low? And why do I have a beard... ... ? Hey! You, you put my soul into my husband's body!
My God!  You've put our souls into the wrong bodies! Never mind about this, you have to tell my son <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Layte</FONT> about this. He is in the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Crystal Room</FONT> now. Ask him not to worry.
My husband is beside me. Please return his soul to his body.
..................
You have finally returned the souls of my adopted parents to their bodies. But... ... ... Have you not yet informed <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Layte</FONT>!?
Please return the souls of my adopted parents to their bodies! They are at the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>entrance of the River Plains</FONT>. No one knows what will happen if you put their souls back too late!!!
<FONT COLOR=#00ff00>You returned</FONT> the souls to the bodies of Tolan and Susana! But... ... ... Have you not yet informed <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Layte </FONT> of this?
You seem to have lost one <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Revival Stone</FONT>. I'll give you another. Try not to lose this one.
Hurry, make some room for me!!!
My God!!! Have you lost the two <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Revival Stones</FONT> that I gave you? What a bother! Alas!  Let me try to find you another <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>two</FONT>.
Hurry, make some room <FONT COLOR=#00ff00></FONT> for me!!!
<FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Tolan and Susana</FONT> should have been <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>at the entrance of the River Plains</FONT>. Quickly, return their souls!
Hurry, return to Layte!
Just now, <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Meryote</FONT> told me everything through our special contact method. Do you know how I feel? The one I love is the girl who grew up with me. No matter what she is, <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Worm Princess</FONT>, or whomever, she is the one I love. I will never give her up. I don't know whether we have a future or not, but my love will never change. Friend, thanks for your help. I talked rudely to you before. Please don't hold it against me. This is for you. May you be happy! Please bless me as well.
What on earth have you done to my parents? Why don't they move? They seem to have lost their souls
You stinky one!!! Never mind that you put our souls in the wrong bodies. You have to tell my son <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Layte</FONT> about this. He is in the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Crystal Room</FONT> now. Tell him not to worry.

Eternal Expectation
Worm Princess, who returned to herself at the last moment, makes the most important decision of her life. She decides to wait for her Layte. Can everything turn out well?
Exp x 1000, Money x 100
Defeat Evanescent Red
Achieve victory over Evanescent Red %d/%d
... ... You are back! I knew you would be able to defeat <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Evanescent Red</FONT>, Thank you. You have saved many lives in the two towns... .Oh... ..ye... ...
Give me your hand!
What's the matter with you?
No, no! What I was going to tell you is that you were right! I have taken the medicine. Although I couldn't help you... After all, I gave away the secret of our group. That is to say, I am the traitor, so there is no other way for me to redeem myself... ... but to kill myself.
How can I save you?
You are a fool!
It's useless. I have taken the crystal powder, which will destroy all the devil spiritual power in my body, and kill me. As soon as all the spiritual power in my body disperses, my brain will be destroyed completely. Then I will not have any feeling at all, leaving this useless body... ... I want to ask you to tell <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Layte</FONT> that I have returned to the devil kingdom, and I will never return to the world of mankind. Ask him to give up. Then, he will drop the idea of waiting for me... ... Oh... ..I am so sad. I'm cold... ... my spiritual power is fading... ... Please... ... help me... ... I don't want <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Layte</FONT> to be sad... ... I would rather let him hate me than feel sad... ...
Worm Princess, I promise you
No, no!
Thank you... ... I have never thought the one who would keep me company when I was dying would be you... ... <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Brother</FONT> Layte... ... <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Brother</FONT> Layte. How will I... ... see you again... ...
Really... ... Perhaps it is the biggest punishment for me to promise you... ... It doesn't matter. Anyway, I will have other feelings... ... than pain <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Brother</FONT> Layte... ...
Maybe... ... Being a magical being, I should not be attached to mankind. I am foolish... ... A fool like me is not qualified to go back to being a magical being anymore.
It... it doesn't matter... ... I'm fine. Ah... ... oh... ...
<FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Evanescent Red</FONT> is still <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>wandering on the River Plains</FONT>. Please, kill it for the sake of the people in the two towns.
Alas! <FONT COLOR#00ff00>Worm Princess Meifei</FONT>my love, are you still in the wild fields alone?  How I wish I could fly to you and be with you, to die or to live!
Return information to Layte
You come! Alas! What's wrong with me today? My heart pains me all the time... ... Am I mortally ill? No, I have to keep my strength to see <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Worm Princess</FONT>! Hahaha... ...
... ... Come on
Oh... Worm Princess
Thank you. I will try my best. I plan to take <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Worm Princess</FONT> to live in seclusion on the top of the world after I find her. Then we will not care about the wars between men and monsters anymore. This is my precious treasure, but I think it will be useless to me. Therefore I pass it to you. Take it! Hahah! I am looking forward to that day! Did you say that <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Worm Princess</FONT> is waiting for me <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>in the River Plains</FONT>? How I wish I could meet her soon, but the pressure is on. I'm really worried!
Why are you crying? I will not die so easily. You are too sensitive! Hahaha.

The world was shared by human and ghost, but ghost started to invade human when they became stronger. Human was defeated until the appearance of <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>four brave young men,</FONT> who used their knowledge to defeat the ghosts. Yes, they used <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>weapons</FONT>, <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Magics</FONT>, and <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Machines</FONT>. They also learned how to use <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Morph</FONT>. They realized that they can absorb <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>spirit</FONT> from ghosts' dead bodies.<pf>The <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>king of the ghosts</FONT> were sealed in <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>the hell</FONT>.<pf>Later, the four brothers broke up because of their different opinions about the world. They spreaded <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>the seals</FONT> around the world and they developed <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>four societys</FONT> including Knight's <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>mainstream</FONT>, Mage's <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>secret cult</FONT>, scientist's <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>northern society</FONT>, and naturalist's <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>southern society</FONT>.

An Ancient Catastrophe
I heard this from Jilydug, the guard of the Trial Cave. 50 years ago, monsters appeared in the Beginner's Village and killed many townspeople. Jilydug lost his brother but was able to survive. The monster that attacked the village was locked in the Trial Cave. Ever since, Jilydug has stood guard making sure the monster wouldn't break the seal. However, he has aged and would like someone to defeat the monsters that are locked inside the dungeon. Thus, I am asking you to defeat ten <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Dratches</FONT> that are inside the Trial Cave.

The Revenge by Jilydug
The truth about the massacre at the Beginner's Village was revealed by Jilydug. He said that the incident was planned by a boss monster called <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Soul Eater</FONT>.

That skeleton is called the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Soul Eater</FONT>. It's is unbelievably strong. Make sure you are vigilant. Take as many people as you can with you. There are monsters other than the Soul Eater, so going with a large party would be wise.

Right...
Really? This is my secret tip!
Remember, in any situation, you should always be calm, which is the best technique! If you reach <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Level 10</FONT>, go find <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Silspira</FONT>!

Find Miro and talk with her
You! It was you! I think you can help me!
What?
Such a polite person
I'm not that type of person
Good! Your voice interested me.
I didn't say anything
I don't want to talk to you
I came all the way from Soul Lab to meet you.
I haven't said yes yet
Great! So we decided! You have a simple recipe that needs your help.
You just don't listen...
Enough! Stop complaining! Come back later!
This is me. Leave if you don't like.
Good! What did you say?!
God, don't believe there is such kind of a person like you.
Your words hurt.
Oh? I owe you an apology.
Your words hurt
This is not important! Anyway, I need a small favor from you. Come to see me later.
......
See you later!
How is it? Did you find anything?
Recipe
Miro asked me to collect <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>10 Gob's blood</FONT>, <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>5 Mirror Parts</FONT>, and <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>1 Copper Ore</FONT>. They should be around the Trial Cave.
Experience Points x 60, Gold x 150
I will know what to do after talking with Miro.
Don't worry. How do you know if I didn't tell you what to prepare.
You have such a bad attitude
......
I told you. This is me.
You need to collect <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>10 Gob's blood</FONT>, <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>5 Mirror Parts</FONT>, <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>1 Copper Ore</FONT>, and some Brick Agent, which can be bought from the Salesman.

I need to get his item, which is written in the quest log.

Great job on those gob's blood! I don't need these Mirror Parts and Copper Ore now. Here is the money I owe you. You may buy some medicines. Hahah....

What should I do next?
......
So delicious.
Whatever... Next?
Next, I need you to soak your hands in this medicinal liquid.
No problems, right?
No!
It would be alright. Just swelling for several days...
What?!
Alright... You need to go to Trial Field to find dirt hills, which will help you attract monsters. 5 of them would be fine.
Think about it.
What do you mean by that? I can be hungry too.
For experimenting?
Next, I need you to soak your hands in this medicinal liquid.
What? So disgusting...
Oh... (soaking the hands...)
Sigh...
Alright... You need to go to Trial Field to find dirt hills, which will help you attract monsters. 5 of them would be fine.
Are you done with cooking? Where are my <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>5 Fruit jellos</FONT>?
Flip 5 dirt hills in Trial Field
I have to flip dirt hills (%d / %d)
(You think it is a bad idea to put your hands in the dirt again.)
(Put your hands in the dirt)<pf>(You feel something bite you!)
(Nothing special about this dirt hills.)
I don't feel anything.
(Normal, wet dirt.)
(It?fs wet dirt.)
(Plain dirt)
(The dirt feels cool to the touch, everything looks normal.)
(You will have nothing to do with it now.)
(This must be a sand!)
(This hill is too far! I don't think slime would come all the way over here!)
Please, do something for the experiment.
Go back for Miro
You are back?
(Tell her what happened)
No, I haven't finished yet
See? I said it would be interesting.
Oh... I guess it was...
My hands are still itchy
Since you are so interested, I will give you big reward. I will test if this medicine works.
As I said, it will be ok in a few days. Thank you for your help. I will test if this medicine works.
So please take care of these dirt hills. They should be easy to find in <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Trial Field</FONT>.
A series of unfortunate events
Miro asked me to get information from frustrated <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Jidy</FONT>, <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Jillydug</FONT>, and <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Belkana</FONT>.
Experience Points x 50, Gold x 200, Fame x 2
Talk with Jidy
Sob... my sister is gone! Together with a guy named Blijan!
Oh
I can't go home like this! Wah....
I didn't hear <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Jidy</FONT> crying at all. Don't fool me!
Check if Jillydug has any trouble
I always want to get revenge for my brothers, but I am too weak! Young man, can you help me?
I don't have time
Alright, you can do it when you are free.
What happened to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Jillydug</FONT> who went to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Trial Cave</FONT>?
What does Belkana do in the cave?
Brother Blijan! Where are you?
But, Brother Blijan, how did it take so long? Maybe...
You must have gone to kill demons, right?
Having any trouble?
(Didn't hear you)      Brother Blijan...Brother Blijan...woowoo!
What happened to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Belkana</FONT> after she went to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Trial Cave</FONT>?
Please tell Miro the information we have.
Oh! You are back! Have you heard any trouble from them?
Jidy's sister is gone
Talk to you later
It is easy. He should go back and report to the adults in Beginner's Village. By the way, what happened to Jillydug?
He mentioned revenge
Revenge? Revenge is bitter little sweetheart. Maybe I should have thrown a gas bomb in to the Trial Cave, then, everything would be fine.
Brother Blijan will die too
Too much!
Brother Blijan? What is that?
Oh, that's Belkana's woes
Oh, the trapped-in-love girl...
Ok. I see. Then, let me think if I should help them. This is something for your endeavor. Keep it.
Thanks!
Only this much?
Let's talk later. I have to think about some new recipes.
Don't be greedy! I am already very generous! Go! Go!
For the peaceful and clean Beginner's Village!     Actually I couldn't control my blood thirsty. Hahaha!

Good, then the second one.<pf>Second question: Can others find my team request through Hunter Stone even if we didn't enable the function?
Yes
No
You have to set the team cooperation open to be seen by other explorers.
If you don't open your request through the Hunter Stone, then the others will not know.<pf>The third question: Can I send invitation to anyone at anytime? This question is more about moral. Even though there isn't a correct answer, I have a suggestion.
It's alright but not polite
Whenever when I want
Right, if you send your invitation randomly, you may surprise your friends. So you should ask them first. And be polite even if they refuse you.<PF>Ok, you can graduate!
It's ok. But you should have thinked about others.<PF>Ok. You can graduate!
This is such a tough question that we machinist society cannot even answer. Sorry, you've got the wrong answer.
Welcome to this world, young one. I am <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Kikibiassa</FONT>, the eldest of the 3 sisters that will teach you how to survive. It can be dangerous in our world, but you will always triumph so long as you keep your wits about you. The monsters that we know as the Umbra will show no mercy, even to a young warrior such as yourself. Would you like to learn the basics?
How to Chat
How to interact with others
What is the Hunter Stone?
About master/pupil
I feel my head will explode!
Communication is the key to becoming a great warrior and protector of Luciena. Talking with your friends, allies, guildmates and the numerous people you'll meet through out the world will often lead to new discoveries, help you further your skills, or embark on new adventures. So let's get started!
Let's bring up the Chat Interface. See the 1, 2, and 3 sections? They represent <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Channel Select</FONT>, <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Symbol</FONT>, and <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Channel Filter</FONT>. These areas are where your messages are going to appear.
Typing is a snap. Check out this picture.<PF>You can <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>click this with your mouse</FONT>, or <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>press the Enter key</FONT>to activate the chat field. Afterwards, just type in your words and press Enter, and other players around you will see  your message.
Going down the list, let's start with section 1, Channel Select.  We can change channels via he function key. The channels are <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>General</FONT>,  <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Whisper (for private chats)</FONT>, <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Party Channel</FONT>, <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Guild Channel</FONT>, and the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Master and Pupil channel</FONT>.
Next we have the Channel Filter. There are some messages you want to see and some you may not want to see. You can use this function to filter them. For example, you may not want to bothered by someone, then you can remove the 'General Channel'. <pf>Afterwards, you will not see any other messages from other players. Go with the option that  works best for you!
As far as Symbols, you use them for chatting!  In addition to selecting them directly, you can just enter the symbols on your keyboard for the right expression!
Please remember that while chatting, you can not use any hotkeys. If you want to use your hotkeys, click anywhere except the Chat interface on your screen.  If you have something important to say to your friend, it's better to go somewhere safe first, unless you become so adept at killing the Umbra that you can switch back and forth!
You can access additional options by moving your cursor and right-clicking on any player. A menu will show up, and you can invite the player to talk, trade, or, even better, invite him/her  to your Friends List.  I'd recommend that you add at least 4 friends as soon as possible. Five fingers are weak separately, yet as one, they form a fist!</Text>
You can find a fabulous shiny totem in every village. It's known as the 'Hunter Stone'!
What does it do?
The 'Hunter Stone' provides a way for players to form parties and battle the Umbra. It was created by the mighty minds of <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Neo Machina</FONT>, which you'll learn more about later. <pf>To use the Hunter Stone, you have to<FONT COLOR=#00ff00> Setup Search Key Words</FONT>. For example, you can check who wants to join a party, what his/her level is, and current classes.
After you finish setup, press <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Search!</FONT> You'll get your results, a list of fellow adventurers who are looking for parties. Be sure to team up, you never know what can happen when you combine attacks...
What's 'Party Status Setting'?
You need to turn on this function before joining a party. After that, it's happy hunting.
How do I use it?
Select it, and choose your conditions for a party. Give it a hot when you have a chance, it's pretty simple.
Master and Pupil is a system that allows a ore experienced Warrior to take a pupil, and assist in training them to combat Umbra.</Text>
You can click on <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>C</FONT> to open the Status window. For more details, talk to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Rumile</FONT>. If you have a aster or a pupil, (Must be over Level 40 and talk to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Houshu</FONT>), you can see list of <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Masters and Pupils</FONT> when you open the Status window.
When Master and Pupil form a party together, the pupil can gain more experience. After finishing the battle, the pupil can have <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Bonus Points</FONT>. When you have enough  Bonus Points, you can get a cool title!
Of course, the master benefits as well. If a aster takes an adventurer under level 40 as a pupil, the master can gain Bonus Points as well. When these Bonus Points accumulate high enough, the Master can also gain something, such as special name or something extra...</Text>
Ok, just take a quick breathe, come back and let me know when you're ready.

Firstly, you have to learn how to open the Map.
How can I?
It is easy. Just click on the little map on the top of your screen. The icon is on the right side. Of course, you can use hotkey, 'M' to open the map.
What does map say?
You can know the topography and the location of entrance to another map. If you are in a team, you can see where your team members are.   Of course, there is a function to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Memorize Location</FONT> through large map.
What does this do?
This is another instruction, you can read it later!
Small map is set to open, it is located on the upper right corner!
What are these buttons?
This buttons will affect map and zoom effects!
What do color buttons do?
Magnifying Glass?
+ and - ?
Got it
Red, green, yellow and blue button are set to open, close on second push. They are monster (red), non-player character (green), teammate (yellow) and player (blue). When they are active, you will find them on the map.

About this <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Memorize Location</FONT> function, it allows you to bookmark your favorite locations, you get one default set and you can <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>expand up to 20 sets</FONT>. Using this transportation function requires <FONT COLOR=#ffad5b>certain item</FONT>.
How to expand
If you want to expand memories, you need to go to the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>ItmeMall</FONT> to bring some <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Transportation Expanding Scroll</FONT> home. It helps you a lot although you don't have to.
Transportation?
Yeah, transportation will use one <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Saved Point Transmission Scroll</FONT>. If you want, you can go to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>ItmeMall</FONT> to buy. Ok?
Learning can't wait!

Click on the Spirt on <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>the bottom of your screen</FONT>. Then choose <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>item</FONT> from the menu. Also, you can just press <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>B</FONT> on your keyboard.
What's next?
When you want to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>move</FONT> an item to a different page, you can just <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>drag and drop</FONT> the item icon to the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>page tag</FONT> at the top of the window.<PF>Alternatively, if you drag the icon to the page tag and hold it there, you will switch to that page, so you can drop the item into an <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>empty slot</FONT>.
What if the bag is full?
Well, you can put the stuff you don't need to storehouse. This is another quest. What I want to teach you now is to clean up your backpack and make money.
Oh! Show me how
Basiclly, you can find <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Weapon Store</FONT> or <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>weapon store boss</FONT>. They are business man. Remember, the boss will not trade for you. Only will trade for <FONT COLOR=#ffad5b>himself</FONT>. Do not trade  with a wrong person!
When selling items, drag and drop the item you want to sell onto the window 1 shown above. Then a confirmation window like Window 2 will show. Item you sold will not come back so check it here before you sell it.
Every item has detail information, so you should check it before making any decisions!
How can I look details?
First, you right click on the item (equipped or in bag) and you will see its status and details.
For example, <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>[Unable to drop]</FONT> (can't discard it), <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>[Unable to sell]</FONT> (can't sell at stores)</FONT>, <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>[Untradeable]</FONT> (can't trade with other players) and so on.
What is Lock?
Good eyes! This <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Lock</FONT> is for some unfortunate, unlucky, and un...
Ok, just say it!
Ok, if your account was stolen, or you don't want your friend to use your account, this is handy because you can set your password on it. But I don't recommend you to share an account with your friend.
You can store your items in both backpack and storage. Did you know that?
I won't ask if I knew
Yeah, if you want to use a storage, you need to find a <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Storage Manager</FONT>.
What can I store in storage?
Almost everything you want to. Also, you should know that there is a <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>public storage</FONT> tab where you can exchange items with your other characters!
Equipment is easy to learn. After you open your item, double click on it or drag its icon to your equipment window and here you go! But remember, there will be profession limitation.
Are you sure you're alright?
I will put up my bag first.

Lebant is just the one who taught me how to open the Umbra Guide. Fortunately, I am clever enough to help myself on the rest of it.
Lebant? Who is Lebant?
I want to learn from you
Take the exam
Lebant? Lebant is a handsome guy. His pictures are all over my room.
You are crazy
Haha... I won't be surprised.<PF>I heard long time ago that Lebant killed a lot of demons when they were dominating the world. He must be a son of Cloudy Beauty!  If you want to meet him, you can find him at the entrance of the village.

What are they?
We have already talked about <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Umbra Guide</FONT> layout so I will explain about <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Magical Assult Square</FONT>.
<FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Magical Assult Square</FONT> is very useful too.

And on the left bottom is the effect summary of the layout.
Of course, you can add or remove cards as you like. When you change magic card layout, it will affect the amount of SP you will use.
What's the difference?
The current layouts include follow, battle summon, and magic cards.     <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Follow</FONT> is for bringing the monsters with you. <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Battle summon</FONT> is for summoning the monster during a battle <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Magic card</FONT> is for increasing your power through the combination of cards.   Use your cards wisely!
What is fast summon...?
Yeah, you are smart kid. Let's go back to the first page of Umbra Guide. When you open a monster card, there is a function called <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>fast summon</FONT>.
If you use<FONT COLOR=#00ff00> fast summon</FONT>, you will <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>use 2 monster cards</FONT>. Also, fast summon only apply to the monsters from<FONT COLOR=#00ff00> battle summon</FONT>.

Isn't Umbra Guide very interesting?
I forgot what I wanna say... I'll let you know when I remember.
Quest Log keeps the record of the quests you completed. It includes the quests with experience and money rewards, quests in <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Meteor Pit</FONT> and <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Thunder Hill</FONT>, <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>everyday quest</FONT> from those organizations, and many others!

I'll listen
I don't wanna hear it
Listen carefully, young one, I shall tell you the history of this world. We used to share this realm with those known as the Umbra, who were interested in power. However, this power only came to them through the suffering of others. They began kidnapping children and others to explore this power further and then they suddenly disappeared without a trace.<PF>Many years passed, until one fateful day, they returned-with much more power than they originally had. They attacked villages, enslaved the inhabitants and wreaked havoc across the land. Many warriors fell to their onslaught. All seemed lost until the appearance of <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>four warriors: Morfey, Masamune, Yuric, and Meruna,</FONT> who used their knowledge to defeat the Umbra in 12 epic battles.<PF>Their skills were revolutionary, they used <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Swords</FONT> and <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Magic</FONT>, and harnessed the power of <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Machina</FONT>. They also used special techniques, such as <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Morphs</FONT>. As the battles continued, they utilized Spirit Absorption, <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Soul Power</FONT> from defeated Umbra.<PF>Using these techniques, they drove the creatures back to the Umbra Realm, and followed them to finish the battle! The bravery of these warriors was a sight to behold...four souls against nearly 200 million Umbra! Yet, after a thousand days, they finally triumphed.<PF>The <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Umbra Lords, the PenUmbra, and their leader, the OtroSoul</FONT> were sealed in what Morfey called a Hisii Chamber, and left within the Umbra Realm</FONT>. Later, these four warriors began to spread their teachings, based on how they viewed the world, and the Soul Seals they understood. That is how this world came to be.
Got it!
How can I help you?
Beginner, you have graduated. This bracelet can protect you. You should find <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Kite</FONT> in Trial Field. He is in charge of fight skills.

Rare Stone Pillars
In the Wastelands, there are Stone Pillars standing in a strange formation. The pure, soothing atmosphere in that area cleanses the evil from people who visit there. That's why the people of Meteor Pit decided to make the place a holy Mecca. However, the environment is growing less pure due to the monsters spawning there.

The Stone Pillars in the Southern Area
After you defeated the monsters roaming around the Wastelands in the northern region of the Wastelands, Arron realized that the atmosphere was still not completely cleansed. The only possible explanation is that some problem exists at the Wastelands located in the southern area of the Wastelands. Because the pillars resonate with each other, the pillars in the southern area must be impure.Therefore, Arron wants you to go to the southern area of the Wastelands and defeat the monsters you encounter lurking around the Wastelands.

The Boss of the Stone-Formed Road
Von, the cook obtained the legendary Narcissus Herb, but in order to create his masterpiece, he has to add some ingredients that are currently missing.

Yes, its done. This is the dish that I wanted to make. It's called '<FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Narcissus Water</FONT>'
It's done! It's done! This is the dish that I really wanted to make. It's called '<FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Narcissus Water</FONT>'

Aired News
Because you accidentally released <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Priest Celine</FONT>'s carrier pigeon, he is unable to deliver a very important letter. You need to take responsibility for the situation and deliver the letter yourself to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Fujin's Field</FONT>.
Experience Points x 6403, Gold x 60
Go to Fujin's Field and deliver the letter to Richard
Did <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Priest Celine</FONT> send you to deliver the letter?  It must have been difficult for you to travel from that far away.
Hmm, I haven't got a response from <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Celine</FONT> yet. That's strange.
What's the matter? Are you lost? <PF>After leaving Meteor Pit, you arrive at the Spiritual Land, then turn west. And after you pass through the Wastelands, you should arrive at Fujin's Field.
Mysterious Phenomenon at Aired.
Recently, the slime monsters in Fujin's Field have been gathering. The guards at the gate are too busy with their own duties to investigate this phenomenon. So, I want you to investigate the activities of the slime monsters.
Experience Points x 3201, Gold x 40
Defeat 20 Poisonous Tentacled Slime
Quest Target: Poisonous Tentacled Slime
I get it. <PF>There is another monster behind the recent activities conducted by the Poisonous Tentacled Slime, huh? Alright then, now I understand......
Your bag is already full. You'd better organize it. Otherwise, I can't give you the important item.
You're not done with the investigation yet?
The Army of Vampires
Due to your report, Richard sent a scout patrol out to the Southern area. However, a powerful Vampire King Child from the Vampire family suddenly materialized. Now, to make the scout's job easier, Richard wants you to go wage an assault on these children, who go by the name of <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Drappers</FONT>. The scouts are waiting for help. In fact, you are their only hope......
Experience Points x 4788, Gold x 51
Defeat 25 Drappers and report back to Richard
Quest Target: Drapper %d / %d
Spectacular! Thanks to your presence, we were able to push the Drappers back! Now we'll just wait here to be rescued. Then, we'll be able to wipe the Drappers out.
Your bag is already full. You'd better organize it. Otherwise, I can't give you the important item.
I'll leave the Drapper problem to you!
Boss Monster
Richard finally figured out the reason for the mass gathering of Vampires. It was because their boss appeared and all the families are trying to become more cooperative under its presence. This will definitely pose a threat to the human race. Brave one! You must defeat this boss monster, the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Synthesized Beast Chimera</FONT>.
Experience Points x 17158, Gold x 142
Defeat the Synthesized Beast Chimera and report back to Richard
Quest Target: Synthesized Beast Chimera %d / %d
Wonderful! I didn't think you would be able to defeat that boss monster, the Synthesized Beast Chimera. But now that their boss has fallen, it'll be easy to hunt the rest of them down.
Your bag is already full. You'd better organize it. Otherwise, I can't give you the important item.
I don't think it will be awfully hard to defeat the boss monster, Synthesized Beast Chimera, but still, you must be careful!
The Attack of the Stone Statue Gargoyle
Inias, the leader of the Aired Guards, was seriously scratched on his leg by a Stone Statue Gargoyle. Because he is still limping, he is not able to patrol that far. Thus, he wants you to teach the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Stone Statue Gargoyles</FONT> a lesson.
Experience Points x 2692, Gold x 32
Defeat 15 Stone Statue Gargoyles and report back to Inias
Quest target: Stone Statue Gargoyle %d / %d
Yeah! That feels good. Now I can relax.
Your bag is already full. You'd better organize it. Otherwise, I can't give you the important item.
Great! Thank you very much. You avenged for me.
Skittering Merrily
Because Inias, the leader of the Aired Guards, was slacking off, he inadvertently unleashed a couple of monsters. Merrily is a monster that is far from normal, and is very powerful. Inias cannot handle the situation on his own. To save him from getting fired, he wants you to help him resolve the situation.
Experience Points x 4454, Gold x 51
Defeat 18 Merrily-Men and report back to Inias
Quest Target: Merrily %d / %d
Oh, that was close! Thank you so much for helping. As thanks, this is a little something. please, take it.
Your bag is already full. You'd better organize it. Otherwise, I can't give you the important item.
Let's keep this just between us, okay? Don't say anything about this to anyone.
Repeated Chaos
When Inias, the leader of the Aired Guard, went to the Northwestern Region with his soldiers, he accidentally dropped an ancient treasure that has been passed down from generation to generation. He wants to retrieve it, but because he specializes in support and healing, he almost certainly cannot defeat the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Mummy Mage</FONT>. So, he has asked you to retrieve the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Family Cross</FONT>, his family treasure.
Experience Points x 5803, Gold x 61
Regain the Family Cross and give it to Inias.
Quest Item: Family Cross %d / %d
Great! This must be my family treasure, the Family Cross!

If I can't retrieve it, what would I say to my ancestors......
Investigation of Spirited Away
In the Lost Cave, a scream resonates for a long time, giving off the impression of a cry full of vengeance. To discover where the origin of the howl and also to check on the condition of the monster locked inside the dungeon, enter the dungeon and defeat the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Dungeon Bat</FONT>. After doing so, collect <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>15 Memory Pearls</FONT> and give them to Kakukou.
Experience Points x 14675, Gold x 64
Give 15 Memory Pearls to Kakukou
Quest Item: Memory Pearl %d / %d
Wonderful! You collected 15 Memory Pearls? Then leave everything else to me.
I need at least 15 Memory Pearls in order to gain complete information about this matter.
Purifying the Water Source
The spiritual power inside the Lost Cave is starting to grow filthier. Maybe something happened to the seal and the monster locked inside escaped. If you can manage to defeat the monster, then the water source may become pure again.
Experience Points x 18422, Gold x 150
Defeat 25 Cave Water Imps and report back to Kakukou
Quest Target: Dungeon River-Child %d / %d
You defeated the river-children that were in the dungeon, already? Then let's go investigate the situation inside the dungeon.
Please find out what's going on -- as quickly as possible......
Monster Jar (Part One)
Recently , a new monster started to spawn inside the dungeon. It's called <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Vampire</FONT> and it is rumored to have mutated from a normal vampire, either under the influence of spiritual power, or else because it was summoned by someone. Kakukou has already determined that this monster was spawning from the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Monster Jar</FONT>, but he was not able to destroy it. That's why he needs your help......
Experience Points x 32578, Gold x 120
Find Oumou in the Wizard's Cave, located in Thunder Hill
Can you tell Oumou, the Mage of Clairvoyance, that I want him to make a Sealed Powder?  I think you'll be able to locate him in the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Wizard's Cave</FONT>.
Okay... I think I understand the situation. <PF>I can make the Sealed Powder, but I'm short on some of the ingredients right now. Sorry to have to ask, but can you go to the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Wizard's Cave</FONT> and look for them?
Give 30 Vampire Bones to Oumou
Quest Item: Vampire Bone %d / %d
I'm waiting for you to bring back the Bone of Vampire.
Wonderful. If you will wait just a minute, I'll whip it up really fast.
I'll be waiting for you to bring back the ingredients.
Monster Jar (Part Two)
Kakukou has determined that this monster came from the Monster Jar, but he does not have the power to destroy it. So he wants you to seal the Monster Jar, if you can......
Experience Points x 73302, Gold x 540
Give the Sealed Powder to Kakukou of Fujin's Field.
Is this the Sealed Powder......? <PF>Wait just a minute... I'll quickly create the Sealed Spell. <PF>......<PF>............<PF>..................
Obtain the Spell
Go back
I created the Sealed Spell. Now then, sticking it onto each Monster Jar in the dungeon should do the trick.
Your bag is full.

Alright, please deliver the powder to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Kakukou</FONT>: he who sees the future. You should be able to find him at the entrance to the Lost Cave.
Use five Sealed Spells for the Monster Jar and Seal each of them.

Great, so you sealed that Monster Jar, right?  Then if we do just do something about the remaining Vampires......
Alright, please deliver the powder to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Kakukou</FONT>, he who sees the future. You should be able to find him at the entrance to the Lost Cave.
Raid of Chaos
Recently, a strong wind has been blowing from deep inside the dungeon. It seems like some strong spiritual power has been converted into this wind. This should be a sign of something important. The only thing that is apparent is that this wind is coming from the deepest depths. There must be a powerful monster down there and defeating it could prevent the chaos that might soon come.
Experience Points x 167258, Gold x 754
Talk to Kakukou, he who sees the future, at Fujin's Field
.........Did Oumou say that? Then there should be no mistake about the matter.<PF>Recently, a strong wind has been blowing from deep inside the dungeon. It seems like some strong spiritual power has been converted into this wind. This should be a sign for something important. The only thing that is apparent is that this wind is coming from the deepest depths. There must be a powerful monster down there and defeating it could prevent the chaos that might soon come.
Look for <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Kakukou</FONT>, he who sees the future, at Fujin's Field and warn him that something chaotic is about to happen. He should be at the Entrance to the Lost Cave.
Defeat the Grand Master Jiang Shi and report back to Kakukou
Quest Target: Grand Master Jiang Shi %d / %d
Impossible! The Grand Master Jiang Shi, who was sealed away hundreds of years ago, has reappeared? I didn't think such a thing could happen. <PF>Thanks to you, though, nothing serious came of it.
Sorry about asking everything about the Secret Cult to you.
The First Depth
The Deep Lab has always been the target of rumors among the common folk. The rumor was that the Head of the School was insane and created a monster, which then destroyed the school. However, no one was ever able to find evidence to support this tale. Admoff, the scholar, wants to solve this mystery once and for all, and to do so he has some requests......
Experience Points x 9783, Gold x 85
Deliver the Letter written for Catlina
Can you give this letter to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Catlina</FONT>? Currently, she is guarding the entrance to the Deep Lab that is located in <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Fujin's Field</FONT>. After she reads the letter, she should give you orders.
You have a letter for me......? Oh, it's from my brother. He has instructed me to help you investigate the mystery surrounding the Deep Lab. <PF>He also gave me a letter of entitlement to enter the Deep Lab. But, you know, it's not so easy to enter the Deep Lab.<PF>There are many monsters near the entrance,  so you will need to do something about them first.
There are always extremely dangerous monsters lurking around here. You should leave in haste.
Defeat 30 Blue Demons and report back to Catlina.
Quest Target: Blue Demon %d / %d
Wow! It's difficult for us to defeat even this amount of monsters.
I think I'll leave the monsters to you.
Can you give this letter to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Catlina</FONT>? Currently, she is guarding the entrance to the Deep Lab that is located in <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Fujin's Field</FONT>. After she reads the letter, she should give you orders.
Scattered Clues
The records only show that the Deep Lab was destroyed after the robot that the insane Principal created went out of control. But that does not explain how Deep Lab became a ruin and also how the other monsters started living there. But before we can make progress in answering these questions we first have to defeat the monsters that are now living here. Maybe after we do that, the reason for the Lab's collapse can be proven.
Experience Points x 21478, Gold x 166
Give 30 units of Pumpkin Lamp Oil to Catlina
Quest Item: Pumpkin Lamp Oil %d / %d
Good Work. I also want material from other monsters.
I want to study material from other monsters. Maybe we will be able to find some kind of correspondence.
Give 30 Old Fabric to Catlina
Quest Item: Old Fabric %d / %d
Great. It'll take me a little bit of time to perform this investigation. Why don't you return in a while.
Still not enough?
Search for Research Material
Catlina thinks that if she checks the research material, the reason for the attraction that the monsters seem to have for this Lab will become clear. She doesn't know if it was simply the case of the robot losing control or if it was a failed experiment that made this all happen. That's why she is asking you to collect the data.
Experience Points x 54888, Gold x 388
Give three pieces of research material to Catlina
Quest Item: Research Data %d / %d
Let me see that......A two legged robot, a connection between machinery and spiritual powers, and the creation of a Homunculus. What were they trying to do? I need a bit of time... then I will report to you after I have collected my thoughts.
I need three pieces of research material. Go look for them.
Homunculus
After looking at all the research data, Catlina formulated a hypothesis. This insane Principal created an artificial life form that might have been a robot, or it might have been a... oh, never mind. Let's call it a robot for now. So, was this the reason for the destruction of Deep Lab...?
Experience Points x 167258, Gold x 754
Defeat Bullcan the Mechanical Supervillan, and report back to Catlina
Quest Target: Little Franken %d / %d
What? That artificial organism has intelligence? And it is seeking revenge? How surprising!  I didn't think humanity could create a cyborg...
You haven't found that Robot yet?
The truth concerning Deep Lab
After all the incidents that have transpired, the mystery surrounding the fall of Deep Lab was solved. Catlina wants you to return and tell Admoff what happened and also what was discovered about the Lab.
Experience Points x 14666, Gold x 210
Go to the Holy Spirit Church in Meteor Pit to find Admoff
What's wrong? Leave immediately. Go to the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Holy Spiritual Church</FONT> in Meteor Pit to look for my brother!
So that's what happened. I didn't think the fall of Deep Lab had any connection to the experiment performed by the Principal. <PF>What else is surprising is that the artificial organism had a heart and was traumatized by being abandoned there. So that explains why he flew out of control and started attacking people...

Not enough! I need more time. Can you go again and attack those monsters?  It's all up to you!
Monster Evacuation
Because you have defeated the monsters that were attacking the peddlers on Main Street, people are now able to pass without harm. This has also allowed Cham to conduct a more detailed investigation. According to his research, these peddler-attacking monsters were living on the street after losing their niche in the eco-system. And this was due to human expansion. Cham wants to conduct further, broader research, but for that, more monsters will have to be removed from the general vicinity. Cham will need your help to defeat the monsters that would impede his investigation.

Monster's Flight
While you were battling the monsters that were impeding Cham's research, he made a lot of progress. Apparently, their presence was not due to evacuation, but flight caused by fear. And it seems that there are more monsters running toward this location and that they are attacking people without reason. Cham wants to learn about this incident in depth, so he is asking you to defeat the monsters that are fleeing in this direction.

No - I'm afraid that's not enough! I need more time. Can you go out once more and fight those monsters? It's all up to you!
Monster Protection
The research completed while you were fighting the  fleeing monsters has finally produced a definite explanation for their flight. Cham says that numerous Water Drinker are now occupying the forest and have evicted the monsters that existed there previously. The monsters, acting out of fear, ran away, toward our town, leading to this incident. But why did the Stone Gargoyles appear deep in the forest? Cham wants to know the answer to that question. So he now is asking you to draw the Stone Gargoyles' attention by attacking them, which should enable Cham to complete this part of the research.

Thank you for drawing the attention of the Water Drinkers. I was able to sneak inside the dungeon. It seems like this is the Plague Dungeon, which is rumored to have ghosts inside. The Water Drinkers seemed to be protecting the enormous tree that stands near the dungeon. <PF>And despite using a magic incantation that allows me to have contact with nature, I couldn't successfully communicate with that tree. Maybe the evil spirits within the Plague Dungeon were interfering with my magic.<PF>I don't have the whole picture in focus yet, but our research has certainly been successful in reducing the attacks targeting the peddlers. I don't have the ability to venture into the dungeon again, so I can't continue my investigation. Instead, I think I should return to the tribal leader and report everything that I know. Thank you for your help. Without you, I don't think I would have been able to come this far.
Your bag is full. Come back after you organize it.
They're still not distracted. Can you draw more attention towards you? <PF>If not, I can't enter the dungeon.

The Gold-Maker Sophina, who supplies fuel to the Blacksmith shop in San Joel, is bothered that there is a shortage of help to collect the Transparent Crystals as a result of the sharp increase in the number of Small Spiritual Power Stones. Because you have successfully helped the Blacksmith shop overcome this energy crisis, Sophina hopes to employ you to go to Amethyst Cave to collect Transparent Crystals for her to extract Small Spiritual Power Stones, and to take <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>the five Small Spiritual Power Stones</FONT> to Emily, who is responsible for delivering the stones to the Blacksmith shop in <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>San Joel</FONT>. By the way, besides taking the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Crystal Samples,</FONT> don't forget to make <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>some room</FONT> for the Transparent Crystals, or else you cannot carry them.

No problem. I have some extras. I'll give you another one!

Haven't you said that you would go to seek the Small Spiritual Power Stones? What's the matter? Your good luck didn't do anything for you?

Of course, this does not mean that ordinary monsters do not have this ability. They just have a lower chance. By the way, thanks for the Transparent Crystals you brought last time. The Spiritual Power Stones extracted have been all given to Akbakov for his experiment. Recently, he has asked me for more. How about it? Are you interested in bringing me some more?

Vigilance averts peril
With the Small Spiritual Power Stones you brought last time, we have finally overcome the energy crisis. However, to avoid the same situation from happening again, we'd better store some Spiritual Power Stones that can last longer and are more stable. Therefore, we hope you can go to the deep Purple Crystal Cave and collect raw materials for the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Transparent Crystals</FONT> and send them to Marie <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>to extract the Small Spiritual Power Stones</FONT>, and then take them to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Apprentice Adrokov</FONT>. By the way, besides taking the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Crystal Samples,</FONT> don't forget to make <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>some room</FONT> for the Transparent Crystals, or else you cannot carry them.

Go to the Nongreen area
Ask the Blacksmith shop not to worry about fuel for the time being, although some orders require iron materials of high-purity, and although the fuel is made from <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Large Spiritual Power Stones which are produced in the Nongreen area</FONT>, there are not so many of them. Although at present the Blacksmith shop is not in great need of them, the supply is still insufficient, considering the difficulty in collecting them. This is the main reason that we cannot apply them in large amounts. In order to improve quality, we hope you can go to Amethyst Cave South side to collect raw materials for <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Transparent Crystals</FONT> and send them to Sophina; <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>then take them to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Apprentice Adrokov</FONT>. By the way, since you have the Crystal Samples already, make sure you have extra space for the Transparent Crystals or you won't be able to pick them up.

Experimental research
Sophina deduced that <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>after the monsters in Amethyst Cave</FONT> eat the Transparent Crystals produced by the Crystal Group over a long period of time, they produce special crystal items that are bright and fair hexagon cylindrical crystals, in exchange for the digested Transparent Crystals. A kind of mysterious Spiritual Power Stone radiating a soft light can be extracted from them! For Akbakov's experimental research, you have to go to the Amethyst Cave to kill all those monsters in order to collect the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Transparent Crystals</FONT>, and bring them to Sophina to extract the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Mysterious Spiritual Power Stones</FONT>, and then take them to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>the researcher Akbakov</FONT>.

The Legendary Treasure
Among all those collected books in Soul Lab, there is one called the Astounding World Record, a book that records all the world's discoveries. Recorded in it is that in a science fair, a gold maker disciplined a diamond-shaped crystal the size of a fist, which emitted a special light. According to the figure, that diamond shaped crystal had much in common with the Spiritual Power Stone! If there does exist such a stone, it might be a Gigantic Spiritual Power Stone sufficient strength to offer power for a long time! It is not enough to only have one clue. Er, maybe Sophina, who is also a gold maker, knows about it.

Ask for information about the Gigantic Spiritual Power Stones
Why haven't you gone to Sophina to get information?
Recorded in Astounding World Record, is the fist-sized Mysterious Crystal discovered by gold maker Hart. Er, if one associates the two together, there should exist Gigantic Spiritual Power Stones which could supply great strength for a long time! To find this treasure in the air, I can think of only one possible theory, the altered extraction! It means that it comes from a change of the mysterious spiritual power in the chemo-synthetic organisms of those monsters!  However, those monsters that undergo such a transformation are usually long-lived, and accomplish this purification over a long period. Then they are able to gain more power, and become the leaders of powerful monsters that are hard to deal with! To find these items in the air, I can only suggest that you <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>go to Amethyst Cave to kill the powerful monsters</FONT>! Of course, this doesn't mean that ordinary monsters do not necessarily have this ability. They just have a lower probability.

The Food Crisis
Recently, business is booming at the Mirage Oasis Hotel. The demand of foodstuffs, especially the staple Fire Spirit Fruit, has greatly increased, though their income grows. However, the supply is restrained in short term unless some one can help in collection as the Botanist George is cited. We must solve this urgent problem right away. But we can't make it since we have to stay in the kitchen to do the cooking. So, we hope you can go to the Waterfall Tunnel <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>to collect Small Spiritual Plant</FONT> and send them to George <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>to make them into Fresh Fire Fruit</FONT>, then bring them to the inn <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>for Cortny</FONT>, Motel Lady Chef. By the way, besides <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>taking the Spiritual Plant Sample</FONT> for the collection, don't forget to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>reserve room in your back pack</FONT> for the plant. Otherwise, you definitely wouldn't be able to get it.

Fresh Fire Fruit
Botanist George who supplies foodstuffs for Mirage Oasis Inn is in great trouble because he is short of hands for the collection of Small Spiritual Plants, the raw material for newly grown magical Fire Fruits, the demand for which has been booming recently. George wants to hire you, who now has experience, to go to Waterfall Tunnel again to collect Small Spiritual Plants for her for processing newly grown magical Fire Fruits, since you successfully helped the inn in the settlement of the food crisis. And <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>you should send five newly grown magical Fire Fruits to</FONT> <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Trian</FONT> who is in charge of sending foodstuffs to the Mirage Oasis Inn. By the way, besides <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>taking the pictorial book of Spiritual Plant</FONT> for the collection, don't forget to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>reserve room in your back pack</FONT> for the plant. Otherwise, you definitely would not be able to get it.

Delicious Food A
Is that the Fire Fruit that is delicious in the legend recorded in George Plant Book by botanist Shijen? It is the fabled mysterious magic treasure that can be used continuously -- the Ripen Fire Fruit!   Such clue is not enough. Well, Botanist George, who is the descendant of Shijen, might know something about it.

Ask George about the fabled Fire Fruit.
Haven't you seen George to ask about the information?
Is that the Fire Fruit that is delicious in the legend recorded in George Plant Book by botanist Shijen? It is the fabled mysterious magic treasure that can be used continuously, <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>the Ripen Fire Fruit</FONT>!   If so, I can only think of one possible theory as the clue for the treasure. That's mutagenic purification. The treasure may be produced from the variation of the magic power generated from the biological combination of monsters that swallow plenty of Sphere Spiritual Plants  But, usually such monsters live long lives to enable such variation. The process of such purification must take quite a long time. It's more likely that, consequently, they acquire enormous powers and become chiefs that are hard to deal with.  To find the fabled treasure, I can only suggest <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>you might try your luck</FONT> by hunting powerful monsters in Waterfall Tunnel. Of course, it's also possible that a common monster has the crystal. But the prob ability of that being the case is much lower.

But recently, <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>great accidents have happened near the Sandfall Maze</FONT> frequently and the goods to be delivered have been lost here.  of course, the sand Fountain merchant do not have the ability to find the goods themselves, so they invite the Sand Fountain Antique Caravan Captain Briton to help them.

Great Foresight
According to the deduction by Briton for the mineral resource in the Sandfall Maze, he purposefully scatters the small pouches in the Sandfall Maze and lets <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>monsters</FONT> pick them up and help to exploit the gemstone mine. Then he seizes back the portable pouches and asks Briton to remove the seal, and then he takes out the unexamined raw stones. In order to set his foot in the line of gemstone exploitation, he asks you to go to the Sandfall Maze to sweep the monsters and collect <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>these small pouches</FONT>. Send them to Briton and ask him to remove the seal and make them into <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>the unexamined raw stones</FONT>, which you will then bring back <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>to Size</FONT>.

Unexamined Raw Stones
Sand Fountain Commercial Team Captain Briton is very annoyed when he starts providing the mineral sources of gemstones-unexamined Raw Stones- to the Commercial Team Evaluator, because he is short of hands for collecting the Portable Pouch of raw materials. Therefore, he hopes to hire someone like you who has experience to go to the Sandfall Maze, and <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>collect the Portable Pouch and give them to him so he can de-seal them and make the unexamined raw stones</FONT>.

Create Another Summit
The style, origin, and site where the fabled gemstones were last seen are recorded in countless accounts of Oasis Antique. In it <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>, the Emperor's golden jewel-- Tear of Meteor</FONT> which disappeared in the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Sandfall Maze</FONT>!  At that time, the famous <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>steel bullet Antique</FONT> was responsible for transporting the gemstone. The Tear of Meteor was <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>packed in the fabled</FONT> Jewel Pouch</FONT> that could store and make the gemstone intact and perfect <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>for a long time. It was an unexpected thing that they came across <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>the joint attack of many monsters</FONT>. Only one of the antique members escaped. Of course, the Tear of Meteor disappeared without a trace. Ah, you <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>can ask Briton</FONT>. He who is the descendant</FONT> of steel bullet Antique might <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>know something about it. But, don't expect too much. This type of treasure is something that can probably only be found by chance, not by striving to look for it.

It is true that I am the descendant steel bullet Antique that was responsible for transporting the Emperor's golden jewel-- Tear of Meteor at that time. That transportation was unsuccessful.

In order to assist his inquiry, you need to go to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Holy Plain</FONT> and collect <FONT COLOR=#ff0000>50</FONT> <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Shred of Swords</FONT> that contain the energy of the Demonic Edge.This should help Tima complete his research.

Quest Item: Shred of Sword %d / %d
What a great job you've done completing this quest in such a short period of time. Sorry to have made you undertake this tough job. Take this item, I used it a lot when I was working in the Meteor Pit Patrol. I hope it will help you in some way.
Hey, your bag is already full. Come back after you've organized it!
The <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Demonic Edges</FONT> spawn in droves in the area <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Southeast</FONT> of the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Holy Plain</FONT>. If you go there, you should be able to collect them easily. After completing that quest, come back to me.
Collect Cake Ingredients
Ofilia is baking a cake and until she is finished she cannot do anything else. However, she just realized that she needs two more ingredients to make the cake even better. First, she needs <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Aged Wine</FONT> made with the grapes that are currently in season, and second, she needs <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Cream</FONT> that will make the cake taste Little Sweethearter. The <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Aged Wine</FONT> can be obtained from a merchant called <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Hikaro</FONT>. He is an expert on wine, due to his experience as a wine taster 10 years ago.He should be hanging around the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Tavern</FONT>. The <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Cream</FONT> is obtainable from <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Wiyu</FONT>. She should have some since she loves cooking and uses it in her sauces. She is living in the area <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Southeast of the Village</FONT>.
Experience Points x 100, Gold x 25
Go to the Tavern to look for Hikaro.
The ingredients for the cake are the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>wine</FONT> and <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>cream</FONT>. <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Hikaro</FONT> should be able to give you the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Aged Wine</FONT> and you should be able to find him at the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Tavern</FONT> right now. <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Wiyu</FONT> should be able to give you the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Cream</FONT> and she lives in the area <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Southeast of the Village</FONT>. Understood? Good. Then bring the ingredients back quickly. Without them, the cake will not taste as good.
The wine that I drink after a hard day of work makes me feel at peace. Wouldn't you agree, young one? Oh, you came looking for someone? Who, me? Well, before you start up, you should know that talking to me will cost you. I don't listen to useless information unless there is a reward of some sort for me. I'm a merchant as you know. I don't do anything that won't benefit me.
A Question from Ofilia
You're very realistic
<FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Ofilia</FONT> wants to know about wine? Why don't you tell me all about her. She sounds interesting... I genuinely think that I want to know all about her. If I can get some info on her, why, I would even pay you. That wouldn't be such a bad trade. I just got a new wine that is not so highly rated, but it is very rare. And I'll give it to you for free! You know, I am rarely so generous. In exchange, can you tell Ofilia what a good thing I am doing for her?<pf>Tell her that I found this wine just for her! Make sure you do that ok?
Your bag is full, isn't it? Organize it so you have enough space to take this alcohol to Ofilia.
Hahaha, I'm a merchant. This is no place for a young child like you to be hanging around. Go home.
Go to the Southeast of Meteor Pit to look for Wiyu.
Did you know that not only does this meal taste good, but at the same time it is good for your health? A rumor is going around that a cook who has his right hand wrapped in a towel is going around the world teaching people how to cook. I can't wait for him to come to this village! Well, I know that it is just a rumor, but... Alright, I'll give you the left over cream that I have. Give this to Ofilia will you?
Oh! There is no space in your bag! Organize it, okay?
The ingredients for the cake are the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>wine</FONT> and <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>cream</FONT>. <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Hikaro</FONT> should be able to give you the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Aged Wine</FONT> and you should be able to find him at the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Tavern</FONT> right now. <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Wiyu</FONT> should be able to give you the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Cream</FONT> and she lives in the area <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Southeast of the Village</FONT>. Understood? Good. Then bring the ingredients back quickly. Without them, the cake will not taste as good.
Deliver it to Ofilia quickly! Make sure you talk good things about me.
You lost the wine!? You didn't drink it did you?  You're still young. You shouldn't be drinking a wine as valuable as this. Even though I'm giving this up for free, it is only beneficial for me if you give it to Ofilia. So, be careful this time. And make sure you don't drink it!
Your bag is full, isn't it? Organize it so you have enough space to take this alcohol to Ofilia.
Collect the ingredients and report back to Ofilia.
You're back! Now I can bake a tasty Cake. Come over here. Let me give you this reward.
The ingredients for the cake are the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>wine</FONT> and <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>cream</FONT>. <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Hikaro</FONT> should be able to give you the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Aged Wine</FONT> and you should be able to find him at the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Tavern</FONT> right now. <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Wiyu</FONT> should be able to give you the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Cream</FONT> and she lives in the area <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Southeast of the Village</FONT>.

Give this to Ofilia right now. If she puts this cream on the cake, it should taste wonderful!
Whoa! What do you mean you dropped the cream somewhere?  I would feel much better if you had eaten it because it looked so delicious. If you really did drop it, then I'll be disappointed. This cream is about the highest quality there is and it is nearly impossible to produce such a large amount in one sitting. So be careful. Don't drop it ever again.
Oh! There is no space in your bag! Organize it, okay?
Ofilia's Thankfulness
Ofilia wants to thank her friends, <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Roarin, Hikaro, and Wiyu</FONT> by giving them her <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Hand-Made Cake</FONT>. However, she does not have the time to deliver the cakes herself, so she wants you to deliver one to each of them. <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Roarin</FONT> should be around the nearby <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>lake</FONT>. He is a very artistic person and loves art. <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Hikaro</FONT> should be at the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Tavern</FONT>, and <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Wiyu</FONT> should be at the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Lodge that is to the southeast</FONT>.

This is a cake from Ofilia? Oh, thank you!  Her Little Sweethearts taste as good as Wiyu's meals.

Did you deliver them all?  What!? Not enough cakes? Wait a minute - you didn't eat them did you?  Well, I guess I can't blame you since my cakes are so tasty. It's a good thing I had made extra or I would have had you pay to replace them.
You need to organize the bag in order to pack the cake.
Go to the Tavern to look for Hikaro.
This... Is this Ofilia's handmade cake? I never thought I would be able to eat such a delicacy. Now I'm thankful for coming to Meteor Pit. Thank you, young one!
You have something that you want to give me? Well, where is it? Don't use me as your excuse for coming in here. I think I should talk to the bartender about making a sign that says <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Adults Only</FONT>. What do you think?
Deliver these cakes to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Roarin, who should be around the lake</FONT>, <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Hikaro, who will be in the Tavern</FONT>, and <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Wiyu, who is living in a lodge that is to the southeast of the Village</FONT>. I will give you a reward when you return.

Did you taste this cake? Oh, it tastes great!  The wine and the cream each give such depth to the taste. It's like getting hugged by my mother. Hopefully some day I can eat this again.
Go to the Southeast of Meteor Pit to look for Wiyu
Ofilia's cake has now finished baking? I can smell it from afar. I'm so excited to have a chance to taste it. Haha.
The cake disappeared? Did somebody steal it?  You'll have to go tell Ofilia about this. And if you can, see if you can get a replacement. And if you can get a replacement, make sure you get one for me!  Kaiyu loves Ofilia's cakes, too.
Deliver these cakes to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Roarin, who should be around the lake</FONT>, <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Hikaro, who will be in the Tavern</FONT>, and <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Wiyu, who is living in a lodge that is to the southeast of the Village</FONT>. I will give you a reward when you return.

I feel great! I never felt this way before. Even when I earned a lot of money, I didn't feel like this.
After delivering the Ofilia's presents, report back to her.
You delivered them all right? No problems? Well, you may be young, but you can be trusted. This is your reward. Come back whenever you have spare time. I promise to bake something good for you.
Her cake was really great this time. The fluffy cotton-like sponginess and its Little Sweetheart taste made me forget all my negative thoughts. It made me feel more at peace than ever before.

Ofilia's plan
Ofilia is concerned about <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Wiyu</FONT>, who is so consumed by caring for her brother that she has no personal time to make any friends. Ofilia had the idea to plan a birthday party for Wiyu so that she might meet and get a chance to interact with people she hasn't met yet. Only one problem: Ofilia has never thrown a birthday party for anyone before. So she wants you to go ask <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Roarin</FONT>, who is very artistic and <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Hikaro</FONT>, who is very intelligent how to go about throwing party.

Go near the lake and search for Roarin
Welcome. I have a new item that I just started to sell. That...What? I don't know - maybe the customer who was just here lost it. What do you think? Do you want to add this to your collection?
Uh...That's not right
Nothing I like
So...... Do you have anything else to do other than this? Or......
Question from Ofilia
Just passing by
Ofilia is trying to throw a birthday party. However, I have something else to do, so can you tell her that I can't attend?  I'm really sorry that I can't celebrate Wiyu's birthday, but I want you to deliver this painting to her. This is what I've been working on for the past half year. As for how the party should be organized, I don't really have any opinions on that.<pf>But when you are there, and if you see that the party is going well, could you make sure to give this to her? Make sure you don't lose it, okay? That is the original, and if you lose it, all my hard work will be gone. I won't be able to redraw that painting the way it is.
I know that you are young and strong, but I think you have too many items in your bag. This painting is not heavy at all, but it contains my deep feelings towards Ofilia, so I would like you to deliver it without a scratch. Thus, I would appreciate it very much if you would return after organizing your bag.
The thought of stopping by came over me as I was passing by. No real reason, though. Anyway, I would be happy if she had a positive impression about my painting. This sort of makes me feel as if the distance between Ofilia and me is diminishing. Hopefully her feelings for the painting will grow through the years.
Oh really? I think I will work even harder to make her recognize the value of my artwork. Well, please stop by again.
Go to the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>lake</FONT>, and the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Tavern</FONT> to ask <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Roarin</FONT> and <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Hikaro</FONT> their opinions.
Go to the Tavern to look for Hikaro
Quest Item: Beautiful Bouquet %d / %d
Continued here are my feelings toward Ofilia. Make sure you deliver them to her.
This is no place for a shrimp like you! You need to be an adult to come in here!
I need to talk to you
Say what!?
To me? I don't want to hear it unless it is important. I only have a limited amount of time here. So, go ahead: tell me what you want!
A Question from Ofilia
It's on purpose!
Ofilia? What's wrong with her? Is there something that I can help her with?  You know, I feel like she is more dependant on me now. I feel happy now. However, I have an important thing to do and don't have the time to listen to your questions. Let's do it this way. <pf>The reason I came to Meteor Pit was because I realized the weather over here is perfect for growing new species of plants. To that end, I have received help from an old lady who is living in the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Southwest</FONT>. She knows everything about planting. Her name is <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Nikita</FONT>, and I was planning to go to her place to see how the plants were doing, but because I have other things to do, I can't go there right now. I wonder if you could go get sample flowers from her?  If you do, then I suppose I would be able to talk to you. Hey: what a great idea! Hahaha.
Hey!! You say you have something to say to me? But I'm busy right now!!
If you understand, then go home! You should still be drinking milk!  This is a place for adults, not for kids. Hahaha.
Come back right away. I'll be waiting here. <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>The Flower Lady</FONT> should be in the are just <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Southwest of Meteor Pit</FONT>.
Go to the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>lake</FONT>, and the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Tavern</FONT> to ask <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Roarin</FONT> and <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Hikaro</FONT> their opinions.
Did you give the present to Ofilia?
You lost my painting!? Oh my goodness!  What do we do? I don't know. That was the original and, of course, I don't have any duplicates. There's no way I will trust you anymore.
Report back to Ofilia after talking to the two
You're back. How are you doing? I'm sorry to have made you go here and there for a personal cause. I already know their answers. Hikaro will come here later, and start planning the party with me. If you have time later, could you go to Roarin's place and thank him. His present was spectacular.

I'm going to leave now and visit with Ofilia for a while. So could you tell her that she should not worry about me?
Pick up Flower Samples
<FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Hikaro</FONT> has asked a <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Female Florist</FONT> named <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Nikita</FONT> to develop a new species of flower in the area <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Southwest of Meteor Pit</FONT>. Hikaro is rather busy, though, so can you go pick it up?
Experience Points x 50, Gold x 25
Go to the area Southwest of Meteor Pit to find Nikita
You must be the person Hikaro sent. This is the flower that was developed to his precise specifications. People should find this flower extremely popular. please tell him that this flower was developed through my blood, sweat, and tears. Hahaha.
You're bag is full. No new item can fit in it. Come back after you organize it.
Go immediately to the area <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Southwest</FONT> of <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Meteor Pit</FONT>. Meet <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Nikita</FONT> and pick up the flowers that I asked you for.
Report back to Hikaro after receiving the flowers that he asked for
Quest Item: Beautiful Bouquet %d / %d
So, you're back, Well done. Her planting skills are not half bad, ain't it the truth? I take pride in my Judge of Punishment of character - who will be the best at certain quests and such. Now, about Ofilia's birthday party, I will help out since she doesn't know anything about staging birthday parties. I think we should keep a lid on this, though.<pf>You might tell her the wrong thing if I ask you to tell her that I am coming, so just take these flowers to her, instead. This will serve as a good birthday present, don't you think? Oh, and tell me what she thinks of this present, okay? If all turns out well, I'll prepare a present for you too.
Go immediately to the area <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Southwest</FONT> of <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Meteor Pit</FONT>. Meet <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Nikita</FONT> and pick up the flowers that I asked you for.
You should go back right now and report to Mr. Hikaro. He will be mad if you are late.
You're back to get more flowers? I see. You gave those other ones to your lover didn't you? Well, no worries. All young people are like that, I suppose. When I was young, I received a lot of flowers from many people. It's alright, There are plenty more. Just make sure you tell Hikaro about my green thumb, okay? Ah, to be young again...
You're bag is full. No new item can fit in it. Come back after you organize it.
Hikaro's Quest
<FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Hikaro</FONT> believes that <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Ofilia's birthday</FONT> next month is his big chance to steal her heart. To make that dream come true, he is contemplating giving <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Ofilia</FONT> the flower that he developed with Nikita. If this could impress her in any way, he thinks that he might just be able to woo her.

Mr. Hikaro is a good man, but I can not see him as anything but a friend. Anything beyond that - well... Well, it's sort of like how people need oxygen, but too much will kill them. Maybe I need to talk to him about this.
This...... How thoughtful of Mr. Hikaro this is. But, now that I'm married, I think he will misunderstand if I accept his flowers. Do you still think I should accept his gift?
Take it
Don't accept it
As everyone well knows, Mr Hikaro takes good care of me, and this gift from him is not the first. He did try to give me an expensive gift the time before, but I really cant accept his gifts any longer. These flowers are very beautiful. If they were ordinary, and not so expensive, then maybe I could accept them. But... well... I feel truly sorry for him, but I have to turn Mr. Hikaro down.
You're right. I don't accept gifts from other men because I'm married. Could you please return these flowers to Mr. Hikaro? Make sure you say thank you to him for me, okay?
You dropped the flowers? Well fortunately I have more. Make sure you deliver them to her this time, okay? And whatever you do, don't give it to your lover.
Your bag is full. Come back after you organize it.
Tell my feelings to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Ofilia</FONT>, okay?
Announce the result to Hikaro
I knew she was going to say that, but thank you for telling me! Here, take this. You know, I have the heart of a salesman. I will never give up!
I knew she was going to say that, but thank you for telling me! Here, take this. You know, I have the heart of a salesman; I will never give up!  Whatever you do, please don't bring back the flowers. Looking at them will make me sad.
Ofilia accepted my flowers? Thank you so much! Here, take this gift!
Could you tell Mr. Hikaro thanks for me?  I can understand his feelings, I suppose, but it still troubles me. I really should go talk to him.
Ofilia's Thoughts
<FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Ofilia</FONT> heard from one of the guards in Meteor Pit, that someone went to the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Corpse Church, which is located in the Northeast of Meteor Pit</FONT>. There he saw a person who looked similar to Ofilia's husband, <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Solkov</FONT>. Whether this man was her actual husband or not, Ofilia wants to let him know what she really is feeling.

Quest: Ofilia's letter %d /%d
Are you here on an adventure too? I hear there are rare minerals here. I just got here, so I don't know if that's true yet.
Do you know Solkov?
No I'm not
Solkov? How do you know him?
Where is he?
Just heard
I think that at this moment he's far far away. Frankly, I traveled with him for a while, but because our objectives were differed, we went our separate ways. But tell me, why are you trying to reach him?
His wife is worried
Just asking...
I Have something from Solkov. I was planning to visit Ofilia and give it to her myself, but if you have the time, why don't you give it to her? After I finish up here, I will go visit her in Meteor Pit. <pf>Also, could you tell her that Solkov still loves her?  You know, the guy could not sleep unless he had a look at a picture of Ofilia. Hopefully, they will be reunited and be able to live together again.
Well I know that you should pack your bag with useful items when you are traveling, but I think that bag is too full. You have no space for other items. Come back later with an organized bag, then I will give you the item that Solkov gave to me.
Uh... Nothing. Do you know Solkov, too?
If you find a rare metal, then tell me, okay?
I'll look for it myself, thank you! On the other hand, it's good to meet people in a place like this.
Are you here on an adventure too? I hear there are rare minerals here. I just got here, so I don't know if that's true yet.

You lost the letter? Well it's okay, I'll write it again. The important thing is to tell him about the letter. Okay, here you go. Now go quickly!
I know you're a hard worker, but I think your bag is full... Come back after you've cleaned it out a bit! I'll be waiting!
If you find evidence that backs up her thoughts, report back to Ofilia.
Quest Item: Letter From Husband %d /%d
Did you find him?  I knew it wasn't Solkov. But it is a good thing that you were able to learn where he currently is. Take this reward. It's not anything too spectacular, but it should be of some help to you.
Did you find out the truth about him?
Don't worry, sister Ofilia, Solkov is alright. You'll see.
Concerning Older Sister
Kaiyu has disappeared again. Because of his weak immune system, he catches colds easier than others. But still he tries to go out on adventures like MacMaster does - which is to say, without any regard for his health. He must have listened to one too many of MacMaster's stories, even though all the villagers say that MacMaster is a liar and not to be believed. Well, the time has come for Kaiyu to take his medicine, but he is not back. Can you go look for him?
Experience Points x 100, Gold x 25
Go to MacMaster's house and search for Kaiyu
You came here to listen to my sagas?  Oh, you haven't? Hahaha. <PR>Oh, I see. You came to look for Kaiyu. Well, he was here a minute ago. Maybe he went out back.
Go look for Kaiyu. He goes to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>MacMaster's house</FONT> quite often, so if you go to the area <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Northwest of Meteor Pit</FONT>, you should be able to find him.
Go to the back of the house to search for Kaiyu
Did you see that butterfly?  I just caught a butterfly that was so beautiful, but then I let it get away!<PF>I wanted to catch it and take it back to my sister, but I can't find it anymore. <PF>If you see it, let me know, okay......<PF>Aa......ou......u......can't......Can't breath......Ah . . . Sister!! <PF>(He is starting to pass out!! Should we let Wiyu know about this?)
Go search the back of the house. He might be there.
Go look for Kaiyu. He goes to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>MacMaster's house</FONT> quite often, so if you go to the area <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Northwest of Meteor Pit</FONT>, you should be able to find him.
Go back and tell Wiyu about Kaiyu's condition
What!?  Kaiyu had a spasm? <PF>This is his medicine. Take it to him. Quickly! As fast as you can!
Your bag is full.
Kaiyu had a spasm? That's terrible news! <PF>Go back to Wiyu's place and bring back the medicine. Make haste. I'll take care of Kaiyu while you're gone.
U......OH......Ahaa......Ahhhaaaa
Give the medicine to Kaiyu
Gulp, Gulp......<PF>(10 minutes later) <PF>Thanks. I thought I was going to die. Sorry to make you so worried. I thought I was already used to these attacks, but this one came without any warning. So... Sorry about that. I'll be more careful next time.
U......OH......Ahaa......Ahhhaaaa
Give Kaiyu the medicine!  If it's too late, I fear there's nothing else that we can do.
Did you bring the medicine!?  Then give it to Kaiyu!  My, that was close.
Tell Wiyu that you have completed the quest.
Kaiyu... Is Kaiyu ok?  If I was able to look after him more often ... If something bad happens to him, I just wouldn't be able to endure life any more. I'm glad that he is safe now. <PF>Hopefully there will be a day that Kaiyu will be able to do activities with other normal children. That will be the best day of my life. <PF>Now, here is a little something for helping us out. Thank you so much!
Fyu. That was close. If it had taken us any longer, we wouldn't have been able to save him. <PF>There was once an incident similar to this,  but I can't remember when and where it occurred. If I could remember where it happened, then perhaps Kaiyu would be able to live life normally.
It feels great now. Thank you.

Ulay is currently at <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Thunder Hill</FONT>, but I don't know her exact location...... I know it's a little troublesome and I hate to ask, but could you please go find her?
What's this?  You came instead of Wiyu? I'm really sorry to get her all worried about me. I'll take the things that she sent me. But, can you tell her that the gift was a little too late? I was attacked a month ago! ... Hahaha. I'm just kidding. I know exactly how she feels. Please tell her I'm ok and that I'll be back soon.
I'm preparing for the third cooking contest. Every year the objective is different, and this is it's held in Thunder Hill.<PF>Last year the objective was Tastes that make people drool.<PF>Wiyu got second place, a record that doesn't shame my grandfather's name. This year the objective is Godly Knife Skills.<PF>I don't plan on losing against her. By my grandfather's name, I swear I'll show that my grandfather's skills were number one.
Tell Wiyu that you have completed the quest.
Were you able to meet Ulay without any trouble?  She's the person I am closest to, other than my brother. If something were ever to happen to her, I don't think I would be able to go on living. Now, this is my gift of thanks to you.
Tell Wiyu that my wounds are mostly healed so I'll be back soon.
Creating a Spice
When Wiyu was cleaning her house, she found a recipe that had been left behind by a past cooking Instructor. This recipe involved a spice that will transform any ordinary tasting food into a marvelous dish. However, to create this spice, a flower called the 'Lapios Flower' is required. This flower only grows in high mountains, and is shaped like a star. From that star-shaped flower, the spice can be made. This flower is currently difficult to find, due to monster invasions.Fortunately, the Sickel Weasels love to eat this flower, so if you follow the Forest Sickel Weasels, you might be able to obtain the flower. The Forest Sickel Weasels appear in the Holy Plain, so make your way to the Holy Plain and collect 20 flowers.

Go to Holy Plain and collect the Lazuline Flower
Quest Item: Lazuline Flower %d / %d
You collected 20 Lazuline Flowers already?  Wow, that was fast. Now I can create this spice which my former Instructor invented. <PF>I wonder what it tastes like. <PF>This is your reward for collecting the flowers. Since the reward is so modest, when the dish has been completed, I will make sure that you can be the first to taste it. How about that?  Now I need to start experimenting with this spice, so go on with your business, will you?
Because the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Forest Sickel Weasels</FONT> love to eat the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Lazuline Flower</FONT>,  maybe the Forest Sickel Weasels might be able to obtain them. Forest Sickel Weasels often appear in the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Holy Plain</FONT>. I'll be waiting for you to return.
Friendship and Love
One of Wiyu's friends, <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Gerute</FONT> is the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Leader of the Assaulting Vangard</FONT> of the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Meteor Pit Guards, Sector 4</FONT>. He was sent to the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Plague Dungeon</FONT> to gather information before the assault. The dungeon is filled with monsters that are vicious and greedy. Upon hearing that, Ulay feared for Gerute's safety and wanted to give him this charm to Gerute. She was going to ask Wiyu to deliver it to him, but he had already left for the dungeon. It is too dangerous for Wiyu to go into the dungeon, so she wants you to deliver it to him. Ulay loves Gerret and wants him to return safe and sound. Can you deliver it without saying anything about Wiyu? Will you just tell him that it was a gift from Ulay? Then Wiyu will have done her job as her friend asked her to do, and Gerute will have the charm in his possession.

Go to the Plague Dungeon and look for Johns
Gerute was sent to the Plague Dungeon, but the dungeon is large and I don't know where exactly he is. Since Johns is also in the Plague Dungeon, maybe he will know where Gerute  will be.
You want to know where Gerute is?  I sent him to the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Corpse Church</FONT> to do some research on the monsters. <PF>This dungeon is infested with monsters, so I figured that it will be the same situation down at that church, as well. That's why I sent both Gerute and Sorith - they are the two fastest soldiers in my army. I'm hoping that they can do something about this situation. <PF>We have already lost many of our soldiers here in the Plague Dungeon. Based on our past experience, we believe that our plan will not fail like last time. <PF>In any case, <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Gerute</FONT> is at the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Corpse Church</FONT>, so if you want to meet him, go there.
Go to the Corpse Church and Look for Gerute
Gerute was sent to the Plague Dungeon, but the dungeon is large and I don't know where exactly he is. Since Johns is also in the Plague Dungeon, maybe he will know where Gerute will be.
<FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Gerute</FONT> is at the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Corpse Church</FONT>, so if you want to meet him, go there, but the monsters there are  very strong, so be careful.
The monsters here are too strong. If you don't have any reason for being here, I suggest that you go back. I can't guarantee your safety if you stay.
Retreat
Are you Gerute?
That's better. Make sure you're paying attention as you head back.
That's right. You want to talk to me?
Ulay asked to deliver this
Just asked
You brought this at Ulay's request? She's really a nice person. Isn't she busy preparing for the cooking contest at Thunder Hill?  Sending you just to give me a good luck charm instead of using her precious time to prepare for the competition... She should know that she needs to concentrate on only one thing. <PF>Could you tell her that I'm an adult and can protect myself - thank you very much - and she should concentrate on the cooking contest? I will be mad if she doesn't win. If you have nothing else to do here, you should leave. This is really a dangerous place.
Then leave this place this instant! I can't help you even if you get injured.
Leave this place this instant! I can't help you even if you get injured.
Tell Wiyu that you have completed the quest.
Did you deliver it to Gerute?  Good! <PF>Then I have done my job . This is a gift for you. If I have something to do in the future, I'd like to ask you again for some help.
The look on your face... It seems that you successfully located Gerute. I guess the Corpse Church was not so bad since you were able to meet up with Gerute and return without trouble. Hahaha.
Leave right now! The monsters here are too strong. If you don't have any reason for being here, you should go back. I can't guarantee your safety if you stay.
If you see Gerute again, could you tell him that  I will not lose the competition because I need to prove that my grandfather was the best at  using the kitchen knife. Anyway, I'm relieved to know that Gerute is safe.
You were the one who delivered the charm to Gerute. Thank you very much!  I didn't think that Wiyu would ask someone like you to deliver it. I guess I need to give you something too. Take this. <PF>If you see Gerute again, could you tell him that  I will not lose the competition because I need to prove that my grandfather was the best at using the kitchen knife. Anyway, I'm relieved to know that Gerute is safe.
Boxed Lunch of Love
It has been three months since Johns went into the Plague Dungeon, but it's conceivable that he is working so hard that he isn't eating normal food and getting a sufficient amount of sleep. That's why Wiyu has made him a very nutritious lunch. I want you to deliver it to him.
Experience Points x 5000, Gold x 100
Go to the Plague Dungeon and Deliver the Boxed Lunch to Johns
Wow, I know that she is concerned, but I didn't think Wiyu would make you deliver a lunch for me. This is such an unusual mission. I understand how she feels. Can you tell her thanks when you see her, after you get out of here? <PF>Oh yeah, one more thing. I you are going back to Meteor Pit, could you tell my father, Entarokov, that I'm doing fine?  I want to set the old folk's minds at ease. <PF>Also, tell him to not be so anxious. <PF>Now that we've got all that covered, there is no reason for you to be hanging around here. Go home!
Leave right now! This is no place for a normal person like you to enter. the monsters here are very powerful and we have lost many mates in the battles. I don't want to see innocent people get harmed anymore.
<FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Johns</FONT> is in the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Plague Dungeon</FONT>.
Tell Wiyu that you have completed the quest.
Johns was doing fine? I'm relieved. His mission is not normal, at all. <PF>Before this one, the longest he was out in the field was two weeks. But now this one has lasted three months. Also there are rumors going around about the people who died in the Plague Dungeon. I'm really concerned about Johns. <PF>Of course I believe in his ability and strength. After all, he didn't get that name, Invincible Gigahead, for nothing. This is just a mission that makes me worry. <PF>Well, now that I know he is safe, I guess I'm relieved a little bit. <PF>So now this is your reward. Take it. <PF>You should become a brave hero like Johns by acting just like him.
This is not a place for a person like you to be. Go home.
Johns should worry about himself! Hahaha.
What!? Johns said for me not to worry?  Look who's talking. <PF>I know I'm old, but I still won't be beat by those younglings!  Tell him that and also tell him to stop being so arrogant. He's not almighty, no matter what he thinks, so he needs to learn that he can't do everything on his own. I'm not worried about his ability, but I know a lot of people that have become broken because of one failure. <PF>Those people that are arrogant can also be crushed easily. <PF>So, me worried? Ha! I say he should be worried for himself. Hahaha. Well thanks for letting me know about him. It's not true that I'm not concerned about him. The monsters recently are more vicious than those we had in the olden days. For goodness sake, when will the world ever be peaceful?
Find your Partner
Originally, the assault squad in the Plague Dungeon consisted of five people, including: Johns, the leader; Jell, the sub leader; Sorith, the striker, Marcy, the supporter; and Fity, the medic. A while ago, <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Marcy</FONT> was sent to the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>sub-basement</FONT>, for scouting purposes, but he hasn't come back yet. Johns needs to command the squad, Fity is not trained for combat, so neither of them can go down there. That is why Johns has asked you to go down to the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Plague Dungeon BF2 </FONT> to search for <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Marcy</FONT>.

<FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Marcy</FONT> is in the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>sub-basement</FONT>.
Ha!...... Yeah!.... Marcy the brave will take on all the monsters!  Get out of my way you weaklings! I will not take responsibility if you die of the sonic boom created with my swings! <PF>Oh our leader asked you to call me back?  Tell him that with my lightning fast sword and my steel will, I will have no problem  accomplishing the mission!  If there is nothing else, go back and report to our leader. I'll join you guys as soon as I complete my mission.
Hello, my name is Fity. I was originally placed in Sector 8, but now I'm in Sector 7 of the squad  assaulting the Plague Dungeon. I'm mainly responsible for healing the injured. Frankly, I can't handle any kind of combat, but I can say with pride that my position is very important. <PF>This is a secret, but our leader, Johns, is the son of Entarokov and had the name Invincible Gigahead bestowed upon him by his father. The only difference between his father and him is that Entarokov fought on the front lines, and our leader, Johns, is a commander. But, incredibly, his squad has never failed to complete a mission and never lost anyone in battle. Johns is a very progressive leader.
Tell Johns that you have found Marcy
Goodness! Marcy is always like that!  He is among the top three sword Warriors in Meteor Pit, but has some personality problems. He is arrogant and that easily leads him into danger. <PF>I know that I can trust him, but I'm just worried that if he were to encounter a monster like the Black Wind Grandma... He will be doomed. So, thanks for finding him. This is just a little something for you to express my appreciation. Make sure that you build your own life course with your own hands!
Go and report back to my leader! I want to show my strength by killing these monsters!  Come on! It doesn't even need to be one on one!
You found Marcy, huh? Congratulations. I'll tell you something interesting. Johns may always seem to oppose Marcy, but in reality, he really has a high regard for Marcy. <PF>That's why he hand-picked Marcy to join this squad. Johns goes out to drink with Marcy quite often, too.

Originally, the assault squad in the Plague Dungeon consisted of five people including: Johns the leader; Gerute, the sub-leader; Sorith the striker; Marcy, the medic; and Fity, the medic. When they first arrived at the Plague Dungeon, <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Gerute</FONT> and <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Sorith</FONT> were sent to the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Corpse Church</FONT> to scout. There has been no information from them since, so Johns wants you to go check on them. Also, tell them that If you encounter a monster that you can not handle, turn and flee. If you don't you will be court martialled.

Johns ordered you here?  Then can you go back and tell him that we're in the midst of an emergency and we would like to stay here a little longer?  We won't do anything stupid, I promise and if something happens,  Sorith and I will retreat, so it should be okay. Tell him that.
On my order, <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Gerute</FONT> is currently at the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Corpse Church</FONT>. <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Corpse Church</FONT> is located to the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>west of here</FONT>, but because the monsters there are very violent, You need to be careful. I'll be waiting for some good news.
You're going to find Gerute?  You should know that Gerute has some secrets up his sleeve. During his final test before graduation, he needed to complete a 12-day survival mission. During that mission, he saved both Ulay and Wiyu who were being attacked by monsters. After he came back, they met again and now they are close friends. <pf>But that's not the end of the story. As a result of Gerute's brave act, Ulay has fallen in love with him. It turns out, though, that Gerute is in love with Wiyu. However, if you can believe it, Wiyu is said to be in love with someone else. It's a strange love polygon isn't it?
Tell Johns that you have accomplished the mission
Okay. I got it. <PF>Thank you for undertaking such a mission for me. I'll reward you with this. Now, if you have nothing further for me, I should get going.
Oh, you came back fast. I guess you have the potential of becoming an attacker for this squad. Speed and efficiency are the two most important factors for an attacker. For instance, Sorith of our squad is also called Jumping Rat Sorith in recognition of his speed and quickness. <PF>I'm not really very close to him, but he is the holder of many attack records and honors, and could be described as the most famous person in the village. He's still the same age as I am, so I guess I need to step up my game.
Report back to our leader right this instant! He hates lazy people.
Ability Test
Johns has begun to regard your abilities to accomplish mission objectives quite highly, and is thinking about asking you for some more help while he is on this mission in this Plague Dungeon. However, from here on, the mission will include some battles with monsters. It is inevitable. Therefore, in order to determine where you stand in terms of combat ability, Johns has decided to test you by making you fight monsters on each floor. The first step in gaining Jone's trust is to go to the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Plague Dungeon BF2</FONT> and defeat <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>20 Dranzos</FONT>.

You seem to have had no problem completing that mission. Good work. <PF>Maybe it was too easy for you. But, even if it was too easy, a mission is a mission, so, here is your reward. <PF>Come back after you've taken a breather.
Dranzoes are in the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Plague Dungeon BF2</FONT>. Be vigilant, but take care. Nothing is more important than your life.
Purify the Soul Knight
Currently, the assault squad of the Plague Dungeon is unable to advance into the sub-basement because of the Soul Knight Dullahan that is blocking their way. The other squads have sustained severe damage at the hands of the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Soul Knight Dullahan</FONT>. That's why the grand commander, Kamyu, appointed Johns to undertake the mission of defeating the Soul Knight Dullahan. However, even Johns is at a loss as to how to defeat the monster. With your entry into the squad, however, Johns has formulated plan. He will occupy the sub-basement as you are draw the attention of the Soul Knight Dullahan. In this way we will be able to get a step closer to the goal of defeating the Black Wind Grandma.

The Report #1
The squad charged with the assault on the Plague Dungeon has solved one problem. We need to go talk to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Kamyu, the Grand Commander</FONT> about the situation. Something of concern is that the monsters might possibly attack here when Johns leaves the command center. That's why Johns thinks it would be wise to send you to report to the Grand Commander. He can usually be found <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>outside of the Meteor Pit Sanctuary</FONT>.

You're still here?  Take the report to the Grand Commander without further delay. <PF>These battle reports are among the most important factors of any battle. If you fail to appreciate this and continue to dawdle then I will have to rethink your soldiering  ability.
And you are......?  Oh, so you were sent by Johns, huh? Let me see the report. Okay, I see. The Plague Dungeon is so treacherous because of the appearance of the Evil Tree  Crone of the Black Wind!  Well done. This is useful information.  So, did serving on missions under Johns' command make you interested in joining the Meteor Pit Guards?  Haha, don't be offended - I'm just kidding. I know for a fact that you are highly valued by Johns. But we can not make any exceptions for entry into the Guards. I'm sorry.  At any rate, tell Johns that I want this mission undertaken as soon as possible. I value him highly and I know he can complete this mission without any problem.
Did you come here to enter the Meteor Pit Guards?  We welcome people who possess courage and passion. Unfortunately, you'll have to wait for the next recruiting period.
Good work. It seems like you have just finished a difficult mission,  but now that the next mission is beckoning, you should get going!
Tell Johns that you have accomplished the mission
You're back!  Good. You never cease to surprise me - but in a good way. <PF>This is your reward. I know it's not much, but there are restrictions in place now; so, I hope you understand and cut me some slack. <PF>You met our Grand Commander, Kamyu, right? <PF>Each and everyone of us respect him to no end and he is the perfect role model. Of course, to achieve his stature is my personal goal, too. Let's move on to the next mission now, shall we?  If I need your help, I'd like to call on you. And if I do so, I'll be counting on you to help us out. <pf>We're alright at the moment, though, so if you could, go to the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Corpse Church</FONT> and help  <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Gerute, the Sub-leader</FONT>.
Return to where Johns is. He requires your help.
I see you met out hero, the Grand Commander. He was one of the members that defeated Sir Vampire King 20 years ago with the soldiers of Sector 7. His squad was the only one that survived that battle. After they sealed Sir True Dracula away, our hero was bumped up to Division Commander, due to his remarkable war record. <pf>They call him Immortal Heaven and attaining that status is the goal for every single one of us soldiers.

Collect the Metal Materials.
Gerute was asked personally by Tima to collect the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Destruction Metal</FONT> from the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Machine Crusher Franken</FONT>. According to Tima, this will enhance the weapon's resilience. Gerute is currently too busy to go acquire them, so he wants you to go get them.

Front Line Support
While you were collecting the Destruction Metal for Gerute, he thought he heard a scream from one of his fellow soldiers. As Gerute is currently injured, he can not go help him, so he wants you to head to the front lines and offer your support. The soldier who needs assistance is named <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Sorith</FONT>, and he should be somewhere in the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Corpse Church BF2</FONT>. To find him may require keen perception.

Thanks for helping me out. If you hadn't come when you did, the only thing left for me was to run. Who are you anyway? You're not just an adventurer, right?
I'm looking for Sorith
Gerute sent me
Sorith? Who's Sorith? Haha, just kidding. You were sent here by our Combat Team Vice Captain, right?  Don't tell him that I asked for help, okay? That's embarrassing. Tell our Combat Team Vice Captain that the mission is on course to succeed.
You were sent here by our Sub-leader? No wonder you're so strong. Thanks for helping me out. But, don't tell him that I asked for help okay? That's embarrassing. Tell our Sub-leader that the mission is on course to succeed.
One more push! Blacky the Demon is nearby.
Hurry up and go help <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Sorith</FONT>. He should be in the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Corpse Church BF2</FONT>.
Tell Gerute that you have accomplished the mission
Sorith was doing fine?  Well, he didn't make you promise to remain quiet about the details when you saw him, did he?  The thing about him is that he hates jobs that are troublesome, and loves to make instantaneous decisions. At the same time, he is full of pride and cannot stand to be looked down on by others. Especially when it is by people that he knows personally.<pf>His speed made it hard for him to break through the Monster's defenses and, at the same time, withstand their siege. In any case, thanks for saving him. And here is your reward.
Make sure you don't share important information with anyone else, okay?
Sneak into the enemy headquarters.
When you were away, Gerute was struck by a monster that was covered in lava, immobilizing him. In order for us to retreat, that monster has to be defeated. With Gerute out of the commission, you are the only one who can defeat the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Magma Gargoyle</FONT>.

<FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Magma Gargoyles</FONT> are formidable!

If you're not doing anything, you really ought to leave. It's dangerous for you to stay here!
What have you been doing recently?  I heard that you were helping our Sub-leader, and came back to report on the current situation. Great work!  As for us, the supplies are finally arriving. It seems like we've been waiting for forever!  We were beginning to wonder what we would do without any provisions.
Leave immediately. Our leader values efficiency in our missions above all else.
Tell Gerute that you have accomplished the mission
Thank you for going over there. That was beyond helpful. Now the problem is how to expand on the research conducted at Corpse Church. Maybe I will need to borrow your services again. If that time comes, will you help us out?
Return and tell Gerute that I have received your report, and I am also looking forward to you  completing your quest.
Are you going back to Corpse Church?  Then tell him that the supplies will arrive soon. Also, tell him that as soon as they arrive, we'll issue the recall orders and he can return from there.
Remove the Curse of the Monsters
The monsters that are troubling the assault squad the most are the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Demonic Ghosts</FONT>, and the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Martial Art Sickle Weasels</FONT>. The Demonic Ghosts make people fight amongst themselves, and under the influence of that confused state, it is hard to defeat the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Martial Art Sickle Weasels</FONT> which are extremely nimble.

The <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Demonic Ghosts</FONT> should be wandering around the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Plague Dungeon BF3</FONT>. I trust in your abilities, but please make sure you pay extra attention or you may find yourself in trouble.

The <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Martial Art Sickle Weasels</FONT> should be in the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Plague Dungeon BF3</FONT>. There are also <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Thunder Sickle Weasels</FONT> around that area, so be careful. <PF>They always move in packs so make sure to watch out and proceed with caution.
Supply Line
Fiya the Patrol Medical Captain of the Guards has sent people over to check whether we received our share of supplies. However, we have not received them yet, and, what's more, the delivery crew has disappeared. Johns thinks that they were attacked by monsters, so he wants you to go check on the situation. His instructions are for you to talk to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Fiya, the lead medic</FONT>.

It seems like an ...... emergency! Just take a moment to catch your breath. I'll listen to your story after you get your wind back.
Are you the lead medic?
Johns sent me
I'm the lead medic, but tell me how I can help you. I have so many problems to solve in such a short span of time, I don't have time for  long stories. Please make it as short as possible!
I came instead of Johns
Thanks for the time.
You came here to ask about the supply delivery problem!  To tell you the truth, we did send the supplies a while ago, but it was attacked by the  <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Demonic Edges</FONT> somewhere in the midst of delivery. As soon as we encountered the creatures, we started to faint. It was almost as if we  were getting the life sucked out of us by the monsters. After that, the monsters stole the supplies. Losing the supplies wasn't much of a problem, but the people that were injured was a  concern. They can not be cured by any ordinary means. I know that <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Tima</FONT> has cured people that were in states like this, so can you go to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Tima</FONT>'s place and learn the secret of how to <PF>cure the afflicted?
If you need more help, come back later!

I'll leave that to you. Delivering supplies is an important factor affecting how the war  proceeds. Even if we have strong soldiers, we will not be able to fight if there aren't any supplies. And don't misunderstand: we're not saying that we are a bunch led by a well-known  hero, or that has an excessively-great support crew. Information is critical. That's why it is important to know what is going on right now. If you succeed in gathering it for us, I should be able to give you something from the  supplies that will be sent on to the front lines.
Receive instruction from Tima about how to cure people
It's been a while, huh? What would bring you all the way to a place like this?   (Tell him what's going on)    Well, this is great timing. I just finished conducting research on this illness and have created a medicine for it. For your crew back there, this should be like a blessing from the heavens. Take this to the lead medic. He's extremely busy, but could you make sure to say hi to him for me?  Don't work yourself to the breaking point!  You won't be able to help people if you're dead!
Can you actually fit this important item in your bag?  I think you should check it and make sure that there is space.
Well...... I don't know what to do either. I'm sorry that I can't be helpful...... I'm really  sorry!      Wait a minute...... If the symptoms are the same, then there must be a way to solve the problem! <PF>Recently, the villagers to the Southeast of Holy Plain have been attacked by a monster  called the Demonic Edge. The curious thing is that when they are attacked, they have no external injuries, but they lose their senses, as if they have lost their souls. Can you go to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Holy Plain</FONT> and gather up the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Shred of Swords</FONT> from the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Demonic Edge</FONT>?
Go to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Holy Plain</FONT> and collect the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Shred of Swords</FONT> from the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Demonic Edges</FONT>.

You're back! Thank goodness. What did Tima say?  He is living the life of a hermit right now, but even so, he always seems to find a way to help me out. He is the only one that seriously thinks about our welfare and offers assistance without  any complaint. I'm hoping that he could live peacefully through the final years of his life.  In any case, these are the supplies that have been prepared. Deliver them to Johns. He is expecting them.

Life is more important than anything else.
Deliver the supplies to Johns
Now I get it. They were actually attacked by monsters. <PF>Now I can save our people who came to the Plague Dungeon. It's a shame that we lost so many courageous brethren. <PF>We must offer thanks to the lead medic for giving us more supplies than we need. Now we will be able to sustain ourselves and hold the line. You should rest for a while. You must be tired.

You should leave immediately. Johns must be waiting anxiously for those supplies. It will be a problem if you don't make it back to him in time.
Good. Now we can pack the supplies . . . I mean,  now we can defeat the monsters more efficiently. Thank you very much. But before doing anything else, you should rest. There are hard missions coming up!
Deliver the Supplies
Johns thinks that Gerute must be in need of some supplies, too. So Johns is asking you to go to the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Corpse Church</FONT> and deliver the supplies to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Gerute</FONT> .
Experience Points x 3250, Gold x 37
Give the Supplies to Gerute
Deliver these supplies to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Gerute</FONT> at the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Corpse Church</FONT>. <PF>While you're doing that, I will be discussing the next step with Fity. When you come back, we should talk about moving on.
I feel like I'm becoming a tactician!  Look at me! I may only look like a cute nurse, but here I am discussing strategies and simulating battles with Johns! <PF>On the other hand, thanks to that, now I'm becoming stressed out, by the moment. Oh goodness. I want Gerute to come back!  please deliver the supplies to our Sub-leader right now. Save me from becoming an evil tactician!
What is this? Are you serious?  I didn't think you would be the one who would deliver the supplies to us. We were planning to hunt rabbit for dinner, but now that we have these provisions here,  we should be fine. Staying here makes me want to eat the meals cooked by Wiyu and Ulay. Those sisters are cooking geniuses. I tried to learn how to cook from them, and their instruction made me a little bit more  comfortable cooking. Anyway, thanks for the supplies! I'm relieved.
You don't have the supply? Then get lost right now! Do not disturb me!
Tell Johns that you have accomplished the mission
You're such a reliable person. Just rest for a while, but don't think about running away. I'm the only one who can use a person with skills such as yours.
I really worry about you capability of doing this task, considering that the next mission is the hardest of all. <PF>Well, just rest for now. Our leader will tell you about the mission in detail later.
Return immediately and report to our leader!  Leave this here to us.
Approach him one step at a time
To begin the advance into the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>fourth basement</FONT>, he is planning to defeat the Grudge Knight Dullahans. If this mission fails, there will be no hope of penetrating enemy headquarters.

Everything is under control!  Now take a breather. <PF>Then we will move onto the next mission.
Alright men! Let's move it!  Remember to retreat as soon as you defeat the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Cursed Knight Dullahans</FONT>. Don't do anything else but attack the target. Anyone who fails to follow orders is an idiot.
Communications cut off.
Because of the magical abilities of the Cat-Eyed Ahriman, our activities are being leaked to enemy headquarters. To preserve our stealth, we need to advance after reducing the Cat-Eyed Ahriman's magical power. So, you have been assigned to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Obliterate the Cat-Eyed Ahrimans</FONT>.

With your considerable ability, there should be no problem in succeeding. Now rest. I'll be waiting for you to recuperate.
Push it! You're almost there. After completing this difficult task, we will be able to rest for a while. <PF>Our target is the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Cat-Eyed Ahriman</FONT>, the enemy's information expert. If we possessed that monster's abilities, maybe the battle would have gone much smoother.
Breakthrough: the Final State of Siege
At first, we thought that the Black Wind Grandma was the one ruling the Plague Dungeon, but in reality, she was just the source channeling magical power. It was actually a monster called Fairier that was in control. So, after defeating Fairier, everything should become much easier. You have been given the mission of defeating <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Fairier</FONT>.

The time has arrived. The Goddess of War has blessed us and we have been successful. Good work. <PF>Now take some rest. I am so overwhelmed by the thrill of victory that I can't speak right. Do you think you can come back a little while later?
We have finally arrived here. Gerute, too, must be holding his line of defense for us. The future of Meteor Pit is in our hands. <PF>It is our duty to fight for that future, and for the future of our lives, as well. Personal considerations are secondary for now. We must fight to the death, and will never forget the price paid to fight this battle. We shall not waste this opportunity we now have to defeat <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Fairier</FONT> -- an opportunity created by the sacrifices of our brethren. <PF>This is a must-win situation!
Report #2 on the Battle of the Plague Dungeon
Thanks to you, our mission has shown tangible achievement. This mission will be your last. Deliver this great news to our <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Grand Commander, Kamyu</FONT>. Johns still has some unfinished business to attend to.
Experience Points x 3000, Gold x 40
Give the report to Kamyu
Quest Item: Report of the Plague Dungeon %d / %d
I can see by the lift in your step that you must have good news!  If I remember correctly, you are the one who delivered me the report the last time, right?  Come on now, let me hear the good news! <PF>Ah, I knew it! Johns proved to be a reliable person. The great thing about his commanding, is that he never has any casualties in his squad. <PF>This is the factor that other commanders need to emulate. <PF>What I really want is for you to enter the Guards. There are some limitations as to what role you can take on, but I still want you to join us. <PF>Now, go back to Johns' location and place yourself back under his command. Maybe he is still in need of some help from you.
Did you come here to enter the Meteor Pit Guards?  We welcome people who possess courage and passion. Unfortunately, you'll have to  wait for the next recruiting period.
What? You were still here?  Even though the mission has been completed, delivering the final report is still an  important job. <PF>If we can deliver the news even a second earlier, then that might result in headquarters making a better decision. <PF>I know you are happy that this mission has ended,  but you still need to deliver the news to our <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Grand Commander</FONT>!
Go to our Grand Commander!  It doesn't benefit us if you're killing time here. <PF>Johns values speed and efficiency, so if you don't go right now,  you might get scolded by him.
Tell Johns that you have accomplished the mission
Ah, you're back safe and sound!  Good job finishing this long mission. <PF>I don't know how to thank you properly for all that you have done for us. But, for the time being, please take this gift. I will also grant you the honor of being an <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Honorary Member of the Guards</FONT>. We all need to learn from you. <PF>We were all blinded by our personal goals and desires and lost sight of the original reason for the creation of the Guards. <PF>Even our commanders need to rest their men and work harder to bring out the best of them. I certainly hope to be able to work with you again.
Done! The mission is finally done!  Thank you very much. <PF>Now I can go back and rest. Oh yeah, I'll tell you another secret. <PF>Now that we have spent a long time together, I think I should tell you this. Well, it's nothing special, but I still want you to know. <PF>To tell you the truth, Johns didn't need to become as worked up over this mission as he did. <PF>The reason why he became so serious was not because of the monsters, themselves, but because of what lay behind this incident. <PF>He wanted to find out what was going on that was leading to all the monsters gathering in this dungeon. As I understand it, Johns could easily have taken the monsters out by himself; he didn't really need to ask you for help.
Return to where Johns is. He requires your help.
Find Silver Dust
According to Sorith, the monster army in the Corpse Church consists of undead monsters. These monsters were created by Sir Vampire King and do not have a soul. Also those monsters have indestructible bodies and the only way to eliminate them is to attack them with weapons made of silver. That's why I want you to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>go back to Meteor Pit</FONT> and ask <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Tima</FONT> if finding such weapons will be possible.
Experience Points x 2500, Gold x 50
Go to Meteor Pit and learn from Tima
<FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Tima</FONT> is in <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Meteor Pit</FONT>.
A weapon made of silver to defeat the undead monsters?  I don't have any such weapon. You should know by looking at me and how I dress,  that I have nothing to do with money. You can't find such a weapon here, but I will tell you this.  Maybe <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Hikaro</FONT>, a merchant that travels around the world   and collects rare items, will have something that will match your needs. <PF>Sorry that I can't help you out.
Go to the Tavern in Meteor Pit and learn from Hikaro
Take my place and go learn from <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Tima</FONT>.
<FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Hikaro</FONT> is always at the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Tavern</FONT> drinking, so  he might be able to help you out.
(OH yeah! If I change this, maybe......)  (Okay, the truth is that the reason I want silver is because I want to make a lovely  accessory for Ofilia......) <PF>(10 minutes later) <PF>To Ofilia!?  Well, why didn't you say that earlier?  I told you before, that whatever Ofilia wants, I want too...... So, tell me what you need. No need to hesitate, now. <PF>I think of you as my soul brother!!  So please tell Ofilia that This is a rare item that Hikaro obtained through his hard work! Will you do that for me?
Brother, your bag is full. I know you can't carry this with your bag in such a state. Organize it first.
You still wandering around here, kid?  I told you before that this is not the kind of place for a kid like you. <PF>Now, go back home and drink some milk.
I need silver dust!
I have something to tell you
Silver?  I don't have anything made of silver here. <PF>However, when I went to Thunder Hill, I met some merchants that were selling rare items. They sort of looked like adventurers more than merchants and I saw something shiny in their possession. They said that they obtained the particular item in a holy island and that the item had holy powers capable of damaging the undead. <PF>Maybe that's the item that you are looking for. <PF>Well, I'm a merchant too, you know. If you try to gain something from me, you need to pay something in return, right?  So, how about this?: I'll make it reasonable for you. I'll sell it to you for <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>1000 pieces of gold</FONT>.
I'll buy it
Is there another way?
Great! I knew when I first laid eyes on you that you were an earnest young man. But I want you to know that the money that you are paying me, is not going into my  pocket. <PF>I am donating all the money to a group called the Saving Humanity Club. Indeed, most of the money I earn by selling items goes to this organization. <PF>And now that you've indicated that you're buying this item, you can rest assured that  you're contributing to universal salvation.
Brother, your bag is full. I know you can't carry this with your bag in such a state. Organize it first.
You don't have enough money. Get out of here!

But I want you to know that the money that you are paying me, is not going into my  pocket. <PF>I am donating all the money to a group called the Saving Humanity Club.

I guess we don't have to make a connection.
You came to talk? You know, time is money. I wonder, why are you trying to waste my time? <PF>What?, you're going to talk about that? <PF>Go away!  Don't interfere with my money making!!
Tell Gerute that you have accomplished the mission
Did Hikaro give you trouble?
Time is money. If you don't have anything important to talk to me about, then don't waste my time! <PF>Oh yeah, and also tell Ofilia only good things about me. I'll pay you to do that for me.
Great!  I knew that you would be above to do that. <PF>Now I know that this will turn out well. I really want to ask you to proceed with this mission. Well, take a rest now. <PF>If you truly have the will to help me out, then come back to me later. I'll be waiting.
Take my place and go learn from <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Tima</FONT>.
Divide the soldiers into two sections. #1
The Corpse Church BF2 is separated into two sections, left and right. Right now, Sorith is trying to creating a point of entry through the left side.

One Hand Short
Our target this time is the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Evil Spirit Scarecrow</FONT>. Of all the monsters created by Sir Vampire King, they are the strongest. Moreover, they were the monsters that interfered with our efforts of sealing away Sir Vampire King centuries ago. What happened was that at the critical point of sealing him away, he created these monsters and they broke through the ranks of the army and the seal became incomplete. Legend has it that Sir Vampire King was sealed, but he is actually living.

What's this...?  You've been helping Gerute?  I told him not to strain himself. <PF>Anyway, it was good to hear that he is doing well. I guess I need to give him a good talking to when he returns. <PF>Thank you for the report. Tell him to join us as soon as his job is completed.
If you're not doing anything, you really ought to leave. It's dangerous for you to stay  here!
Go report to our leader right now. He will likely jump for joy after hearing this report.
It turns out that there is a great secret between Sir Vampire King and our Grand  Commander. There are not a lot of people that know the nature of that secret, but it is said that when  the assault squad failed to seal Sir Vampire King safely away, Headquarters became  concerned about their reputation and, thus, decided to go ahead and announce that Vampire King had been sealed anyway. To his credit, our Grand Commander never gave up on this mission, even after it was  falsely publicized as having been completed. He swore that before he died he would defeat Sir Vampire King. You should also know  that there were three main Warriors in the war -- Tima, Entarokov, and Kamyu -- and  they were called the Three Heroes. They were the ones who persisted in the quest of sealing Sir Vampire King. However,  because Headquarters didn't want them to have a great deal of power, Tima and  Entarokov were pressured to leave the Guards. Nevertheless, they are still helping  Kamyu try to accomplish his goal of capturing and sealing Sir Vampire King away.
Tell Gerute that you have accomplished the mission
Tell Gerute to finish up his job and then join us so that we can all return to the Guards  together!
Thanks for giving so much of your time. This is just a little something to show my appreciation, but take it. You deserve it. I don't know if it will be helpful for you at some point, but you should keep it with you. And in the future, I would like to work with you again if I get the chance.
Someone is saying that he will give you something good after you perform maintenance on your weapons. So, you should do it right now!

Thank you for helping me out last time. Now I never let Kaiyu out of my sight. <PF>How's life been going for you?  And, if I might ask, what brings you to my place?
Well, to be honest...
You, beautiful Miss
You came here for Ulay, I heard. She's a great person isn't she? <PF>She's bright, she's out going; of course, she's a little strange, but  You're...... Uh...... Not falling for her are you? <PF>I know she's a good girl and all, but she already has her sights set on someone else. <PF>Wait here. I'll bring back the King's Star Knife. Well, actually, it is just a kitchen knife with an exaggerated name. Ulay says that the name lends it greater presence, but I really don't understand it. Wait here. I'll go fetch it.
Huff, puff, What a heavy kitchen knife this is!  Organize your bag will you?  We can't fit this inside unless you create some space.
Hey, you're good.
Go back to where Ulay is and give her the Heirloom Sword.
Great. If I have this King's Star Knife, there's no doubt that I will win  first prize.
Quickly go back to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Ulay's place</FONT> in <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Meteor Pit</FONT>, and bring back the heirloom knife called the  <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>King's Star Knife</font> that has been passed down from generation to generation in her family.

The monsters around here are very active, so  if you don't have any business around here, then I would advise you to leave right now. <PF>You know, you really should listen to your elders.
About the past incident
That's correct
Well...... Why do you want to know about that? Well, I guess you have come well prepared, yes? <PF>Recently, a lot of people have tried to solve this mystery, so I can't see any reason why we should try to keep it secret any more. As for what I can tell you, all I know about what happened here is that a bunch of monsters started to advance towards the eastern coast. It seemed like they were under the influence of a strong magical power that was coming from the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Ruined Mansion</FONT>. <PF>A <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>small fishermen's village</FONT> was destroyed by these monsters, and, in fact, the monsters are still there. <PF>If you could, do you think you can avenge the poor souls that were killed by these monsters?  One of the strongest monsters in the bunch is one called the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Chimera</FONT>. Sounds like trouble huh? <PF>The Thunder Shrine was built there to keep them confined in the village, but this is only a temporary solution. No peace will truly prevail until these monsters are defeated!
If we don't leave this place right now, we will get hurt.
Go destroy the Chimera
Quest Target: Chimera %d /%d
Quickly go back to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Wiyu's home village</FONT>, and check for any remaining evidence.
I knew you would be able to do this job!  There were others who tried to defeat those creatures, but as you know, they were  unsuccessful. <PF>The aura you have around your body shows great strength. You must be the person that we were longing for all this time. The people who died during that incident would surely be thankful to you for defeating  these terrible monsters!
Good Luck!  Those monsters are creatures that are not easily maneuverable
Tell Ulay that you have accomplished the mission
Welcome back. Sorry, but could you wait for a minute? <PF>I can't seem to be able to remove my hands from this thing. Please come back later.
Thank you for being so helpful. This should help restore peace around here.

About your hometown...
I love you
You...... Why did you...... ah...... ah............ I...... I'm sorry. Sorry that I got so emotional. <PF>You went to my home village?  I can't...... I can't believe it...... Ah...... Sorry. <PF>Would you excuse me?  If you don't mind, I want to be alone right now.

I knew this would be able to touch Wiyu's heart. To tell you the truth, she weeps every night. <PF>She acts like she is fine in front of others, but deep down inside, the slightest thing places her under enormous strain. I was concerned that some day she might completely break down, but you have done it. You have helped her face her trauma. Now we just need to hope that she will be able to overcome it.
Sorry to put it this way, but will you leave me alone?
The Best Ingredients
While you were delivering the news to Wiyu about the Southeastern coastal incident, the sponsors of the Cooking Competition announced the theme for the next dish. Ulay would love to win, but she is unable to collect all the ingredients on her own. So she wants you to go collect them for her.

Go quickly to check on the cause of this fiasco. Representatives from the Prophet Council have been sent already.
Ah, you've returned, I see, just as I expected. <PF>When the pack of monsters was defeated last time, it seems that this incurred the wrath of the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Dying Witch</FONT>, which lives in the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Ruined Mansion</FONT>. Because of her great rage, she started to release more formidable monsters, and one of them was the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Rakshasa Court Lady</FONT>. I want you to go defeat this monster.

Thank you. I don't know what else to say to you. My mental state has recovered a great deal since you last saw me. <PF>If there is a hereafter, then I promise to help you out. <PF>Oh yeah, I have something I want to ask you, if you don't mind. I have been thinking about returning to my home village. <PF>Since I left in such a rush, I was unable to take anything with me. So, first off, I want you to go back there and check to see if there is anything still remaining back there. <PF>The house that I was living in, is near the river-bank. But since I haven't been there for a long time, I don't know how it looks or if it is even there. <PF>I'm quite sure that it was on the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>eastern river-bank of the Thunder Plain</FONT>. I wonder: can you check for me?

Thank you, young one. So, we meet again. And, pray tell, how has life been treating you?

To check in on you
What's with your unexpected arrival......?
I know all about it.
Sorry to surprise you
Know? Know what?  What are you saying? You know about what?  You......
From the people...
You're not a man are you?
I guess you do know, then. Hahahaha, I must say that you are stupid. <PF>Look at this shrine. It's broken. And, why do you think this broken thing would contain some mysterious power?  Because it was broken by the people in the Nine Land Federation who became monsters. They are still holding onto whatever small amount of sanity they possess, and, in the process, they are ruining our plan. Yes, that's right. The spiritual power of this shrine is the power of the religion of Demonic Spiritism!  It's too late now! The seed of power has been planted already. Nothing can stop it now. <PF>This religion is now going to spread throughout the continent! <PF>I don't need this body anymore. I'll be waiting for our next encounter! Hahaha......
Why you...... Don't try to fool your elders.
Don't scare me. I'm really old now, you know, so I can't have any strong shock to my system. If so, it might be too much for me.
Thank you for thinking about me. But there are others that need your attention.
Tell Linda that you have accomplished the mission.
Ouch... We weren't able to catch them again. It will probably be difficult from hereon to capture the people who believe in Demonic  Spiritualism. You were used by them, too, but don't let it get your down. <PF>There must be a way to solve this problem.
......?  Sorry, but do I know you? <PF>...... What?  Who am I?  What am I doing here?
Analysis of Weakness
The strength of the monsters are increasing by the moment, and the Nine Land Federation Army is trying to collect the items that the monsters were outfitted with.

It is said that there are many rich energies contained in San Joel. I hope I can find much treasure there.
Do you know about the Ice Crystal Stone?
What are you looking for?
<FONT COLOR=#00ff00>The Ice Crystal Stone</FONT>! I know that I searched for it long ago. It is in <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>the Ice Cave</FONT>, and as it is the most ordinary mineral in the cave, it is named the Ice crystal. Not long ago, five Ice Crystal Stones were sold in a private silent auction. They were sold at a high price. If one gazes on the Ice Crystal Stones with the naked eye, they will feel clean. But you can only find them around the cave. It is harder to get those in the deep cave.  Comparatively, minerals that are deeper are rarer, and they have different powers. What I do know is that the Ice Crystal Stones can be obtained from the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Wriggling Hand</FONT> and <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Little Ms. Puppet</FONT>.  What's more, I just attended a private silent auction where a mineral explorer ran away when he saw the Ice Crystal Stone I held, which is extraordinarily brilliant. Maybe you will encounter him.
In fact I pursue all rare items around the world, and not just gemstones. I even like things like eyes which change color and golden hair. All of them become objects in my collection..

It is you who brings the meaning, and you that can interpret it with different values. In your future battles, you must decide your own behavior instead of counting on instructions from others. Because you yourself know your own goal, you must want something and fight for it; otherwise it is something not worthy of your time or energy at all.

The physiological function must slow down during the process of sublimation. But this makes the resistance of the body weaken. So I need <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Crystal of Millennium Mushroom</FONT> to balance my physiological function.

Break the spell of Orthy
After the Elder found the method for avoiding the attack of spell, they released the true method  to break the spell of Orthy. The reason why they didn't let us know was that it was too hard to get this magic treasure, and they didn't want anyone to lose their life. So they didn't tell us. In fact, to break the spell, the true method is to kill the terrible demon lord <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>True Abadon</FONT> living on the mountain. Only then can the spell of Orthy be broken.  So I ask you to destroy the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>True Abadon</FONT> and <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>report to Chaewa.

You are really powerful. I had never imagined that <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>True Abadon</FONT> could be defeated by you. <font COLOR=#00ff00>Orthy</FONT> has been restored to his normal state. Thank you very much. I think that the monsters on the mountain won't do evil in the future. And  the villagers don't need to hunt on the mountain with the fear of losing their lives. You are a great benefactor.
I don't think that you have defeated demon lord</FONT> completely <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>. You must destroy <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>True Abadon</FONT>. You have still a bit more to do before you achieve success. Do your best.
Make antidote (1)
A lot of mysterious and unknown secrets hide in the beautiful fairyland. ?meshnalt?was a determined Explorer Originally and is trapped in the fairyland now. The reason is that his body retrogresses to the child from an adult gradually. Nobody knows why such strange change takes place in his body. As long as he leaves the Illusionary Land, his body will age in an instant and return to the former age. So far, we only know that we must get 癒y5 Wings of Blue Bat癒zfrom the body of 癒y<FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Blue Bat</FONT>癒z and try whether we can make the antidote to relieve the instant aging. so you must <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>get</FONT> 癒y<FONT COLOR=#00ff00>5Wings of Blue Bat</FONT>癒z first and <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>report to</FONT> 癒yMeshnalt癒z

It is hard to get the materials, so we must cherish it when using it. Thank you for your help. I will take it and try again, and hope to make the real antidote.
Don't know why we cannot make the antidote. Is the quantity still insufficient? I remember it needs <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>5 Ogre Drunk Petals</FONT> in total. Please make more efforts.
Kind Pumpkin
The antidote relieving instant aging seems to have problems. The efficacy fails to reach what was expected. The recipe of the antidote was learned from a kind pumpkin spirit ago. Later, when the kind pumpkin spirit is asked, other recipes are necessary for the antidote. But only The Thousand Year-Old Violet Pumpkin knows other recipes. So you must <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>find The Thousand Year-Old Violet Pumpkin</FONT> and get 10 pieces of Information of the Millennium Pumpkin from their bodies <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>and give to Meshnalt</FONT>.

The information doesn't seem enough. The kind Pumpkin spirit told me that  At least <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>10 pieces of Information of the Millennium Pumpkin are needed</FONT>.

Although the antidote is made, the body of Meshnaltcannot recover in the fairyland. But as long as he leaves the fairyland, his body will recover to the physiological status of common adults.

Haunting fairy (1)
The investigation result shows that the Fairy of the Ultimate Light of Waterfall Tunnel (south) play tricks. They planted a lot of Delusion fruit and the Ninja Racoon Dogs ate the fruit, unaware of the circumstances. So they become cranky. So you must <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>destroy 10 Fairies of the Ultimate Light</FONT>, and <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>report to Karistner</FONT>. Destroy the source of the problem and see what the result is.

Haunting fairy (2)
In order to teach a lesson to the haunting fairy, destroy some Fairy of the Ultimate Light. However, the problem is that there is no significant improvement to the condition. So the new investigation is conducted. It is not the Fairy of the Ultimate Light that causes trouble while the other fairies are playing tricks. They are Fairy of the Underground. So you must assist Karistner <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>to destroy 10 Fairies of the Underground</FONT> and <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>report to Karistner</FONT>.

Crystalline Mirror
Crystalline Mirror is an ancient legend. The accumulated snow that is shone on by the Crystalline Mirror isn't easy to melt. Crystalline Mirror slows down the melting speed of snow. So the Illusionary Land can maintain such spectacle. But the Crystalline Mirror is placed in the Gold Tower in Death Valley in the south originally. The reason behind the unstable climate of the Illusionary Land of Heaven Mountain is because the Crystalline Mirror was stolen. Recently, the Crystalline Mirror was stolen by the Flower Fairy. So you must assist Karistner to find the Crystalline Mirror. But you must <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>destroy the Flower Fairy</FONT> first, and <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>report to Karistner</FONT>. Karistner will tell you whether the Crystalline Mirror is found. Then ask you to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>to give Mirror of Crystalline to Dai in Death Valley</FONT>. The quest is complete.

You haven't given the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Crystalline Mirror</FONT> that you carry on your body to Dai; the life of the mirror depends on you. Please hurry to give the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Crystalline Mirror</FONT> to Dai.
It is hard to deal with the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Flower Fairy</FONT>. But we have no other methods because we don't know whether the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Crystalline Mirror</FONT> is on her body unless we kill her.
Give Crystalline Mirror to Dai
En... Why do you have the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Crystalline Mirror</FONT>?  Does <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Karistner</FONT> ask you to give me?  Thank you for finding the ancient mirror. I think I should place the<FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Crystalline Mirror</FONT> where it should stay.

Shadow of Darkness
During the investigation within the Wasted House of the Mysterious Shadow, a member of the research team opened a box. A thick, dark mist was excreted from the box and unfortunately, that member lost his entire finger. Not only did the mist cut off his finger, but it summoned numerous monsters that the crew members were not able to control. Becauseof this, the research activates had to be suspended. In order to restart the investigation, the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Box</FONT> that is <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>the source of the mist</FONT> needs to be closed. We are looking for a person who can shut the box and, thus, help return conditions to normal in the Wasted House of the Mysterious Shadow.

Spirit of the Mountain
A few monster hunters indiscriminately set a forest on fire in order to kill all the monsters living in the area. This action made the Spirit of the Mountain known as <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Little Mr. Rocky</FONT> quite furious! Having lost their home, the spirits started to go insane. They decided to take revenge against humans. They attacked people by spitting out sharp rocks, leaves, and branches and the result was that many innocent people were killed. Do you have the intelligence to settle this problem without any more casualties occurring?

Suction Doll
The <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Dracule</FONT> is a low-level Vampire and this is clearly apparent from what they wear: raggedy clothing and dressing like farmers. As they do not have any wealth to speak of, they need to forage for their own food, but this has made them stronger mentally! They are more violent than any other Vampire race and they suck blood from any human available - even womenand children. There are innocent people dying out there. Do you have the power to save the people from such disaster?

String Trap
This was a story told by one of the people in the village, so who knows if it is really true? However, they said that they saw a <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Demon Spider</FONT> that has legs like scythes which enables them to destroy hard objects. They can also trap things with their web. Most worrisome is that they are steadily expanding their territory, step by step. The village folks are scared that they might be eaten by the spiders and are looking for a hero who will take the spiders on and rescue the people from their plight. You're that hero! Please defeat the spiders and protect the village!

Chained Spirit
A spirit that became trapped inside the mirror and could not escape. Failing that, it combined with the mirror to form a monster called the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Magical Mirror</FONT>. It plays with human beings and enjoys watching them suffer. But in reality, it wants the people to somehow break the spell that would release them from the mirror. For, if the mirror is ever physically broken, the spirit inside will die. This may explain why the mirror always tries to strike first. On the other hand, it is rather counter-productive since they require the help of humans! In any case, either be prepared to attack when confronted by the mirror, or help release the spirit from its curse.

Pink Love
A dream of the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Pink Mummy</FONT> is to establish a comfortable household and produce a couple of children with a man she loves. However, these mummies value appearance more than anyone else, making it almost impossible for them to find a suitable partner. Moreover, because they want to produce a pure-blooded child, their frustration keeps growing. When that frustration reaches its peak, this mummy starts attacking humans as a way of alleviating stress. Any male unfortunate enough to be attacked by the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Pink Mummy</FONT> turns into a mummy himself and will also be expected to help make children. This set of events has sent the people of the village into a state of panic. Do you think you will be able to help the villagers by defeating these mummies?

Child of the Ancient Castle
During the ages when a plague was in the air, many children lost their lives. The poor families were not able to bury their dead, so they left the bodies in the Ancient Castle. These babies were transformed into monsters called <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Dracrow</FONT> by the vampire that was hiding in this castle. Because they are kids, Dracrows do not attack human beings; rather they suckthe blood out of local domesticated animals. Although this does not affect the lives of people directly, it will damage their well-being in the long run. Do you have the courage to confront these poor sinning children and scold them into changing their ways?

Copper Moment
The <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Copper Gargoyle</FONT> developed a strong immunity against magic after absorbing a great deal of spiritual power throughout the ages.

In fact, many pedestrians - mainly women and children - have been killed because of them. This has filled people's lives with fear. Do you have the courage to step forth and save them from this situation?

Living, Blood-Thirsty Doll
An evil spirit that has been placed inside a doll, repeatedly takes innocent lives on Lucifer's orders. This is why the monster <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Chuckey</FONT> appears to be alive. It is a fearful creature for a couple of reasons. First of all, it has the ability to duplicate itself automatically when it is killed, so it turns out to be awfully hard to destroy. Secondly, while its frightening appearance may seem obvious to adults, innocent young children are not able to distinguish it from a normal doll! Are you capable of stopping its madness from continuing?

The weak village folk who live nearby do not stand a chance against such a powerful knight. Luckily, some villagers have only been injured. Others, regrettably, have been killed.

Poisonous Hermit
Recently, a weird series of poisoning incidents has occurred in the village. Many people have become inexplicably poisoned, but no one knows for sure who is responsible. One of the possible answers though is that a <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Fairier</FONT> is the culprit. It is true that <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Fairiers</FONT> are not usually strong like this, but the villagers may be inhaling this poison unintentionally. Once poisoned, people start to hallucinate and grow weaker and weaker by the moment. The townspeople are at their wits' end and do not seem to have the patience to deal with this poisoning. So you think you can solve this problem for them?

The Ultimate Battle
The Mage tribal masters entered the Lost Cave with the intention of defeating the Grand Master Jiang Shi. But because they accidentally touched the poisonous corpse they themselves, became transformed into <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Grand Master Jiang Shi</FONT>. Now that they are neither human nor spirit, they are wandering around aimlessly, without a plan or anything to do. This situation has frustrated them and so they have decided to take their grudge out on the people that are living life peacefully. They are using the same tactics on the people as were used against the Grand Master Jiang Shi who was defeated by them. I want to ask you to defeat these monsters so as to save the innocent people. Doing so will also help all the GrandMaster Jiang Shis rest in peace too.

Dark Night of Insanity
Cutting and creating paper dolls and patterns is one of the most popular activities engaged in by girls. However, they used paper as if it existed in endless supply, without thinking of the consequences. Little did they realize that those trees that were chopped down transferred their grudges into the paper! Due to the information written on the paper, it suddenly gained spiritual powers, becoming a monster called the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Spell Book Overseer</FONT>. Now that they have the ability to freely move about, these books can jump out of the rack and strangle people as they are sleeping. Without realizing it, many of the paper patterns created by little girls ended up taking away their lives. And now it turns out that another problem with the spell bookmonsters has arisen: after the Spell Book Overseer was captured inside a grand spell book, people have been saying the Overseers are planning to kill all the people who helped trap them in the spell book. This is something that must be prevented, at all costs. You need to do something to stop them!

Plan for Unified Rule
As science progressed, it affected the fairies greatly. The fairies now can no longer live anywhere else but in the mountains. Unfortunately, this was an environment that they were not used to living in. Although they call themselves the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Fairies of Eden</FONT>, do not be fooled by the name: they have started to attack people, due to the invasion of their living space.At first they attacked people who entered the mountains, and in the process they slowly gained back their territory. And now they have taken residence in a dungeon, plotting the extermination of human beings. Based on the discovery of documents detailing their operation in the mountains, their exact location has been revealed. It is imperative that wedefeat them before they put their plan in action!

According to the few that returned from battle, these Dullahans are equipped with armor that is tinted red and smells like blood.

Underground Werewolf
Take the risk to slide into the unfathomable depths of crystal crevice. Can I find Isala and Arilan, who fell into love with each other deeply?  Attention: The only person who has talked to the sorrowful <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Uncle Granikov</FONT> and helped <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Lime investigate the Crystal Crevice</FONT> can have dialogues with Isala and complete the quest!
Destroy the Evolved Wolf of Arilan
Kill Quest Target: Evolved Wolf of Arilan %d / %d
My God! No! Stop, stop! You killed Arilan. You dared to kill Arilan. I am sure the Fang Wolf you killed just now is Arilan!   I know I have no reason to complain to you, because Arilan has lost humanity and become a Fang Wolf. Everything is caused by my father, the leader of science and civilization, Granikov!  He sold his soul to a demon in order to prevent my eloping with Arilan and signed an agreement with the evil King of Evil Magic. The King of Evil Magic summons the wolf troop to attack the lone residents or travellers. A lot of innocent people are wounded and forced to be separated from their family members. Recently, a lot of missing girls from the town have been taken to meet the Fang Wolf because they cannot endure what they must put up with after going missing and becoming the lovers of the Fang Wolf.  Fang Wolf has the terrible ability to demonize the person he wounds and turn them into werewolves. Arilan was scratched by a Fang Wolf at the night we eloped. His body began to change shortly afterwards. But he didn't tell me and hid here alone. I loved him deeply, how could<PF>it be that I couldn't find out what happened to him. I have sworn I will stay with him no matter what he becomes.   My father is so silly to do such things. He not only failed to break us up, but also ended up hurting more people. Arilan is dead now and I have lost the desire to go on living. You killed Arilan, but I don't fault you for that. I only hope that you can promise me one thing. Please help me to kill <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>King of Evil Magic</FONT> and bring his <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>head</FONT> to sacrifice to Arilan. Will you do this?
Sorry!
I go right now!
I don't want your apology. I only want the head of the Wicked Wicked King. It hurt us so deeply that a lot of people are hurt by Fang Wolf. A lot of couples, lovers, mothers and sons have to leave each other due to this. Everything bad is caused by it. I can spare it!
Thank you very much. It will collapse here. There is a piece of rope ahead and you can crawl out the cranny along it.  You must remember what I have asked of you after you go out and take <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>the head of Head of Wicked King</FONT> and come to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>the Crystal Crevice</FONT> to sacrifice it.
Good bye
I won't go!
Please!
You are young and have a promising future. No need to stay here. The Crystal Cave will be buried by gravel. Go now! You should take vengeance for us! Go!
Who are you! Why are you here?   I get it. You must be a bad guy trying to catch Arilan here. Just go away! Come back after you've cleared things up. Don't trouble innocent people.

My friend, glad to meet you, and sit down for a drink and let me introduce here to you. The Sacred Hilltop is the highest place in Karma Blazing Land and is the place full of holy spirits and purity.  It was said that this was the place where the mysterious old man taught four young heroes. It is also the turning point for human life. So it is civilized here and everyone is full of respect for it. The landscape and terrain are very precipitous and magnificent. I feel quietness and harmony staying here. You should have the same feeling!   Don't you drink? This is the wine brewed by my good friend Batabi. It is mellow. Just try it!
Observe my Power!
Thanks!
Wow! (the Silver Cross stabs in to the chest of Van Helsing)   Why... Why do you do this? You know who I am? I am sure. You know to use <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Silver Cross</FONT> to deal with me. You must know who I am or know I am a demon.  I have left the human world and lived here for many years. Why don't you spare me? Is it me that chose such a fate? You are not cruel enough to kill me in one stroke! Come on. Stab the cross into my heart. Come on!
Sorry!
Go away!
Go away!
Go away!
You don't look good. Are you under the weather?

Do your business first!

My good friend, the priest <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Batabi</FONT> was caught by <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Death</FONT>. <font COLOR=#00ff00>Death</FONT> is cruel in nature and swallows 10 pious priests every year and sucks their souls to strengthen himself. He has inscrutable magic power and is good at black magic. But there is one day per month when his magic power becomes very weak. This is the time when he needs to swallow the priests.  Such a time happens to be today. I plan to go to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Amethyst Cave (south)</FONT> and kill <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Death</FONT> after drinking with you and saving <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Batabi</FONT>.
I promise you.
I don't want to go!
Thank you. We will do it in two ways. You defeat <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Death</FONT>, and I will use Transfer magic to save <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Batabi</FONT> after you succeed.  <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Death</FONT> is good at black magic. You must be careful! Let's go!
Wait, let me think twice.
Go!
We are pressed for time. Make your decision quickly.
Go!
If you don't promise, I will not die tamely. You want to fight with me?
Come to see me after you understand the former business.

Oh! My little hero, you come at the right time. Van Helsing was stabbed with <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Silver Cross</FONT>. And the human will cannot contain the demonic blood in his body, so he has become crazy. Please hurry to stop him.  You ask who I am? Your memory is very poor. I am the priest <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Batabi</FONT> who you saved. I saw your heroic posture when you defeated Death that day you are extremely great! But I am saved by Van Helsing before saying thank you.  It is not the time for us to quarrel. Van Helsing cannot control himself and easily goes crazy. There is a maze behind the Hawk Nest. I don't know where he went. Please hurry to look for him! Please...
Sorry!
Eh, no.
Please! By the way, you should be careful.
Don't behave like that. Big hero. You saved me. Please help Van Helsing.
Kill, kill, kill. Sengen, I want to kill you. You are an evil viper. You help a villain do evil and want to kill me with Sengen. Mankind is very hatefull. I want to kill all humans, Kill, kill, kill.  Aha, aha-aha. I have summoned the most bellicose Demon <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>True Abadon</FONT> in the devildom at <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Sacred Hilltop</FONT>. He is the symbol of terror and death. I will destroy the world and mankind through his force this time. Kill, kill, and kill. <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Sengen</FONT> the mean guy will be first sacrifice. As for you, you just stay here and don't save that rat. (open arms and rush towards me).
Hold your horses!
I go first, bye!
Go away, you traitor! I don't want your false sympathies!
Don't go!
Go away! You, this guy...

Why don't you kill me? You have such a good chance.

My secrect is that I am the son of damned vampire ancestors. I was born with the blood of demons. I have tried to get rid of this fate and try to be a normal person.  But why don't they spare me and they force me. I am really annoyed. I think that I will be free if you kill me. But you let me down. Forget it. You go. Maybe it is fated for me to live in annoyance all my life.

Van Helsing... Is it you? I hoped and waited so lonesomely for so long. You... You finally forgave me and came back to me.  I am so sorry. I used your feelings for me for my own desire at that time. I never stop persuading myself. Love, that is the thing of human. I don't have and never cared for these things. So I cheated you.  When you left me, I found my heart broken. Why could it be so? I am a monster and I don't have feelings like human. But my heart was dying at the moment you left me...
Baby... Baby... I come to see you...
Listen to Van Helsing
Baby, I won't break your heart again.  Come on! I'll take you to heal your wound. You will be ok. We will go to Amethyst Cave after you recover and never, ever separate again.

I will not do things that upset you. I imagined that this day would come every day---the day that you come back to my side and say that you forgive me and will take me away from here...

Trial Field researcher Merol conversation
Merol's conversation. This guy has a good heart although he talks in a not-so-nice way.
Let's start.
I am a graduate student in the Soul Lab. As a student in Science, it is logical for me to research new formulas.
Alright, alright, whatever
I don't have time
Great, I hope everyone should be like you!...     Hey! Hold on! I should tell you what to prepare first!
No time? I will ask for someone else then.
I can't believe it. This formula is not dangerous. Why didn't I pass the last exam?
You are not qualified to help me. You should gain more experience first.
Recipe
Miro asked me to collect <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>10 Gob's blood</FONT>, <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>5 Mirror Parts</FONT>, and <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>1 Copper Ore</FONT>. They should be around the Trial Cave.
Experience Points x 60, Gold x 150
I will know what to do after talking with Miro.
Don't worry. How do you know if I didn't tell you what to prepare.
You have such a bad attitude
......
I told you. This is me.
You need to collect <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>5 Mirror Parts</FONT>.
Oh
How many is some?
Ah... I don't need Brick Agent anymore. You can go back.
Forget it. I still have some left. You just need to get what I told you.
I need to get his item, which is written in the quest log.
Item to obtain: Mirror Parts %d / %d
Great job on those gob's blood! I don't need these Mirror Parts and Copper Ore now. Here is the money I owe you. You may buy some medicines. Hahah.... And I should give you some bonus because you were fast!
