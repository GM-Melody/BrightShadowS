Nice to see you again!
Let's do a quick review
Just stopped by to say Hi
Welcome to this world, young one. I am <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Kikibiassa</FONT>, the eldest of the 3 sisters that will teach you how to survive. The monsters  known as the Umbra will show no mercy, even to a young Warrior such as yourself. Would you like to learn about the basics?
How to Chat
How to interact with others
What is the Hunter Stone?
About master/pupil
It was nice talking to you!
Communication is the key to becoming a true Warrior and protector of Luciena. Talking with your friends, allies, guild mates and the numerous people you'll meet will often lead to new discoveries, help you further your skills, or embark on new adventures. So let's get started!
Let's bring up the Chat Interface. See the 1, 2, and 3 sections? They represent <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Channel Select</FONT>, <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Symbol</FONT>, and <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Channel Filter</FONT>. These areas are where your messages are going to appear.
Typing is a snap. Check out this picture.<PF>You can <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>click this with your mouse</FONT>, or <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>press the Enter key</FONT>to activate the chat field. Afterwards, just type in your words and press Enter, and other players around you will see  your message.
Going down the list, let's start with section 1, Channel Select.  We can change channels via he function key. The channels are <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>General</FONT>,  <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Whisper (for private chats)</FONT>, <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Party Channel</FONT>, <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Guild Channel</FONT>, and the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Master and Pupil channel</FONT>.
Next we have the Channel Filter. There are some messages you want to see and some you may not want to see. You can use this function to filter them. For example, you may not want to bothered by someone, then you can remove the 'General Channel'. <pf>Afterwards, you will not see any other messages from other players. Go with the option that  works best for you!
As far as Symbols, you use them for chatting!  In addition to selecting them directly, you can just enter the symbols on your keyboard for the right expression!
Please remember that while chatting, you can not use any hotkeys. If you want to use your hotkeys, click anywhere except the Chat interface on your screen.  If you have something important to say to your friend, it's better to go somewhere safe first, unless you become so adept at killing the Umbra that you can switch back and forth!
You can access additional options by moving your cursor and right-clicking on any player. A menu will show up, and you can invite the player to talk, trade, or, even better, invite him/her  to your Friends List.  I'd recommend that you add at least 4 friends as soon as possible. Five fingers are weak separately, yet as one, they form a fist!
You can find a fabulous shiny totem in every village. It's known as the 'Hunter Stone'!
What does it do?
The 'Hunter Stone' provides a way for players to form parties and battle the Umbra. It was created by the mighty minds of <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Neo Machina</FONT>, which you'll learn more about later. <pf>To use the Hunter Stone, you have to<FONT COLOR=#00ff00> Setup Search Key Words</FONT>. For example, you can check who wants to join a arty, what his/her level is, and current classes.
After you finish setup, press <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Search!</FONT> You'll get your results, a list of fellow adventurers who are looking for parties. Be sure to team up, you never know what can happen when you combine attacks...
What's 'Party Status Setting'?
You need to turn on this function before joining a party. After that, it's happy hunting.</Text>
How do I use it?
Select it, and choose your conditions for a party. Give it a hot when you have a chance, it's pretty simple.

Master and Pupil is a system that allows a ore experienced Warrior to take a pupil, and assist in training them to combat Umbra.</Text>
You can click on <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>C</FONT> to open the Status window. For more details, talk to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Rumile</FONT>. If you have a aster or a pupil, (Must be over Level 40 and talk to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Houshu</FONT>), you can see list of <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Masters and Pupils</FONT> when you open the Status window.
When Master and Pupil form a party together, the pupil can gain more experience. After finishing the battle, the pupil can have <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Bonus Points</FONT>. When you have enough  Bonus Points, you can get a cool title!
Of course, the master benefits as well. If a aster takes an adventurer under level 40 as a pupil, the master can gain Bonus Points as well. When these Bonus Points accumulate high enough, the Master can also gain something, such as special name or something extra...
Well, we have an old saying around Luciena, the brightest light will cast the darkest shadow. Be careful of the path you walk, for you never know where it can lead you.  You are free to make your own choices, be sure to make the ones that benefit us all.
Thank you! You are so nice! A cruel soul deserves no rewards...
Oh! <FONT COLOR=#ffad5b>You are so nice</FONT>!
Looks like you're making good progress. It is time to explore the past of this world...visit  Gemba, and she shall weave the tale of conflict that envelops Luciena.
Hey, nice to see you again. Have you visited everyone in the village yet?
Beginner's Advisors?
Still exploring!
Yes, they are Item Master <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Doug</FONT>, Traveler's Handbook and Log Instructor <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Teresa</FONT>, Skill Instructor <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Miyabi</FONT>, Character Instructor <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Lumier</FONT>, and Map Instructor <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Cauchy</FONT>. They are around the village. I'm sure you won't miss them!
After you finish your courses, come see me. That's when you'll be ready to explore beyond the boundaries of this Village.
No problem, you can come see me whenever you're ready.
Young traveler, welcome to Luciena. I am known as Basic Instructor <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Kikibiassa</FONT>. You must have a lot of questions! I will help guide you to your chosen destiny. Also, if you finish my courses you will be rewarded!   Are you interested?
Yes, it's time to train!
I am an expert. No, thanks!
Ok, we can start basic classes any time.  Speak with me when you're ready.
If you are not interested, I won't push you.

You want to go over everything again?
Let's review
My path grows difficult...
Which aspect of &lt;FONT COLOR=#00ff00&gt;Character Growth&lt;/FONT&gt; do you want to learn?
Character Data
Upgrades and Rewards
Obtaining/Setting a title
The Awakening
I've got crazy skills already!
Understanding your ability is important! Press <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>C</FONT> to open a window. Of course, you can click on the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Spirit Button on the bottom left side of your screen</FONT>. Both of those options will open a menu. You can also check your current character status that way.
What you can see now is the advanced character status!  In addition to the information on the <FONT COLOR=#ffad5b>upper left side of the screen</FONT>, you can see <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Title</FONT>, <FONT COLOR=#00ff00> Awakening</FONT>, and<FONT COLOR=#00ff00> Status Abilities</FONT>. Other specific functions are<FONT COLOR=#00ff00> Set Title</FONT>, <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Awakening Status</FONT>, and <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Character Reward Points</FONT>.
When your experience reaches a certain point, you will gain additional strength, health, magicand Soul Power. You will also get some <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Ability Points</FONT>. You can use these points to modify your skills--STR, INT, CON, AGI, WIS, and DEX. Open your Character Window, and you'll see it at the bottom.
<FONT COLOR=#00ff00>You'll earn experience by completing tasks, hunting umbra and seeking out the umbra airs for adventures with your friends</FONT>. Of course, when you complete a task, you have a chance to get bonus items...
You can show off your experience through your titles! You'll get a title for completing different  tasks, such certain Umbra being vanquished, helping others, launching Soul Power Attacks, you name it!  There are many tasks within the world, and the collective leaders of Luciena ill often add  Titles for the adventurers that continue to defeat Umbra.
So how do I get Titles?

Open your Character Data Window, then click the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Set Title</FONT> button, you will see all your titles.
Point to the title you want to change, <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Left-click to confirm</FONT>, and you're done!

You seemed to have finished all of your lessons, congratulations! If you go to the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Trial Field</FONT>, you'll see <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Basic Battle Instructor Kite</FONT> who will teach you the basics of battles, and how to best fight against the Umbra.
Hmmm...you seem to not have taken training yet. If you're interested, I recommend going to the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Kikibiassa sisters</FONT> near the fountain.
Basic Battle Instructor Kite
Basic battle instructor Kite will teach you the basic of combat. Study well!
If you want to learn more about battle techniques, standing next to me is <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Silspear</FONT>, an  intermediate battle instructor who specializes in skills. You should learn from him.
So you've come! I would like you to take Second Level Training. Do you want to listen?
Yes, please tell me everything.
Perhaps later...
On the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>beach</FONT> to the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>East</FONT> of this<FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Trial Field</FONT>, the Umbra now occupy the shore. Not only that, but they seem to be robbing things from the villagers. <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Gob</FONT> is a monster that takes everything by force. Can you assist the villagers by clearing the beach?
Perfect, I'm ready for a fight!
Gob's never hurt me, so...No.
Excellent! I'll await the good news!
If only we had more people, I didn't want to cause you trouble...
Alright, I guess I'll ask someone else.
Hmmm? So you want to move onto the second level of basic battle training? Then I will give you one mission. Complete the mission with success to prove to me you've mastered what I have taught.<PF>Recently, there's been Umbra round the entrance of the village. I say Umbra but they're not that bad, just defeat them so they don't come close to the village. Defeat <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Slime Jelly</FONT> near the entrance of the village and report to me. Want to give it a try?
I'll do my best!
No thanks!
Great. I'll be waiting for your report. Good luck!
Alright, I can't force you. As long as you understand what I have taught, its ok.
So, you seem to be interested in level 2 of the basic battle training... Then I will give you one mission. First, I'll give you <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>5 Small Red Potions</FONT>. When you successfully complete this mission, that proves you've learned my lesson. <PF>Recently, there's been Umbra sightings around the entrance of the village. Head out there and make sure that they don't get any closer to the village. Defeat <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Slime Jelly</FONT> near the entrance of the village and report to me. Are you ready?
Yep! I'm off!
On second thought...
Great. I'll be waiting for your report. Good luck!
You inventory seems to be <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>full</FONT>. Clean up your bag and come back.
Alright, I can't force you. As long as you understand what I have taught, its ok.
Hey! Glad to see you again. I suppose you know nothing about fighting. You want to learn first or take the test directly?
I'm willing to learn!
It's test time!
Alright! The first thing I want to teach you is how to use the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Quick Menu</FONT>......
Alright! First let's talk about how to use <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Sshortcuts</FONT>... <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Sshortcuts</FONT> are the two rows of icons at the bottom of the screen. The left being <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Function Sshortcuts</FONT> that allow you to quickly open <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Functions</FONT>. On the right are the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>General Sshortcuts</FONT>. These are used to quickly access <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Skills</FONT> and <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Items</FONT>. I'll explain how to set up General Sshortcuts.<PF>First, open the Item Window, and <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>drag</FONT> an item into the general sshortcut bar. That's it! Isn't it easy? The same goes for skills, by opening the skill window and <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>dragging</FONT> a kill to the sshortcut bar.
Hotkeys are assigned to your keyboard from <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>F1</FONT> to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>F12</FONT>. You can assign your hotkeys to skills or tools. For example, if you drag the icon of medicine to F1, you can push F1 to use medicine when you need. After medicine is used up, you can only recover HP and MP slowly by waiting.
Remember when you click on <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>single target</FONT> it will locate the target <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>and attack</FONT>, and you will see its <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Icon</FONT>, <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>level</FONT> and <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>HP</FONT>. Be sure to watch your target's strength before you attack...it could save your life. After you decide to fight, click on the target and you will approach until you're in range and attack. You will see the effects immediately during the battle as both of you get weaker and lose HP.
My class is over. If you want to continue, please come to see me again. It will not only be  training, but you will also help the villagers! More importantly, you will be <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>rewarded</FONT>!
......
What are you worried about?
I know the hotkeys!
Well, since you already know how to use hotkeys, I'll let you go on your way. If you still have questions, you can look for the answers in Beginner's Village or ask other players. <FONT COLOR=#ffad5b>Can you come again later?</FONT> I have something for you to do...
Alright, take care.
Battle instructor Silspear
Intermediate battle instructor Silspear basic conversation
Young Warrior, I do expect you to grow and help us protect Luciena.
Oh! I knew you will come to me! I have a request to ask you.
What's that?
No thanks
Well, we have a new visitor in Taral Field! But this new visitor doesn't talk to others. Could you ask him what he is doing here for me? He may need your help. If so, take this chance to train yourself.
You gotta help me!
I am sure you will become stronger and you can fight with stronger Umbra soon.  Do you want to take this challenge?
Sure!
I need some rest...
I believe that you are a brave adventurer!   Deep breath first. After making your thinking clear, come and talk to me again!
Come to me again when you are ready!
Hey there, we meet up again. Are you ready for <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>training level 3</FONT>?
Yes!
I'm just passing by!
Good! Good! I think you already know that there are Umbra n the Trial Field. Actually, the level 3 training is easy. Just go to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>the north of Trail Field</FONT>. You can see <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Chuckey</FONT> there. Yes! I think you know the rule. If you can defeat <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Chuckey</FONT>, I will give you a reward. Remember to make use of your skills when you fight with them.
Alright!
I don't want to do that!
I will wait for good news from you.
Okay, I will ask others for help if you don't want to earn the money.
As you wish...
Hey, we met again. I guess you want to know about <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>3rd training</FONT>, right?
Yes!
Not yet!
Good! Good! You know there is a monster called <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Little Mr. Water Drop</FONT>, which lives in the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>north of East Coast</FONT> at <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Trail Field</FONT>?<PF>Well, this mission is very easy. I just want you to defeat <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Little Mr. Water Drop</FONT>. You'll need to make use of your skill to defeat it. The purpose of this quest is to help you become familiar with the skills you know. Of course, I will give you a <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>reward</FONT> after you clear the mission.
Skill and Will--I'm ready!
I don't feel like fighting
Oh, I mentioned the Soul Explosion to you before but I want to tell you more about this powerful technique.
Usually, soul power is green, but sometimes you will see some different colors. The Umbra seem to know what they mean, but we do not understand it fully. All we know is that we can utilize it for a burst of power.
The Soul Explosion meter is on the right side of the character info window. There are five levels, you can't use it before they are ALL full.
Then?
Then, the meter will flash, and you're ready to use it!
The grey button on the bottom will flash as well! Click it to enter explosive status--use it when you need it!
Ok, then you can look after the Little Mr. Water Drops near the sea. Let me adjust your Soul Spark so you can use the explosion...there. Try it!
Ok, I will find another brave soul for the reward.
Okay, comeback any time when you want to continue with the training.
Yeah, kid, are you with <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Kite</FONT>, who helps with progressive battle training?
Yes
Nope
Thank you for coming. Young people don't like studying any more these days... Let's start it. Do you know how to tell between <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Aggressive</FONT> and <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Passive</FONT> Umbra?  Yeah, I think you can tell, it's pretty simple, <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>click on a single target</FONT> then you will see the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>target window</FONT>. It will display the target's <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>name</FONT>, <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>level</FONT> and <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>HP</FONT>.<PF>The target's <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>level</FONT> will appear in different background colors so you can tell.
If the color is <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>green</FONT>, the target is <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>a layer</FONT>, it is <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>passive</FONT> if the color is <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>yellow</FONT>,  and <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>red</FONT> means it is <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Aggressive</FONT> target. Watch for the signs and you can take measures to defend yourself. Never come close to them without being prepared!
What? you seem bored although they are important. Well then, let's cover <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>using Skills</FONT>, ok? If you want to use your skills quickly in the battle, you need to assign them to your <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>hotkeys</FONT>. First of all, open the Skill window, choose a kill and <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>drag</FONT> it to the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>first hotkey box,</FONT> which is <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>F1</FONT>, and then you can use your skill by pressing the hotkey.
Wait, besides magic skills, you also need <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Soul Power</FONT>. Have you heard about it?
In order to get Soul Power, you need to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>defeat Umbra</FONT>, then you will find <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>souls</FONT>. The maximum souls you can collect is different by levels. It goes up when you take your strength to a new level. Soul Power helps you <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>use skills</FONT>, <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>learn skills</FONT> or <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>create items</FONT>. Did you understand?
Ok, you can go out practice now and come back later for further training.
Whatever, it's up to you.
Heh, I can tell that you haven't gone through <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>basic battle training</FONT>, you'd better find <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Kite </FONT>to finish your classes first!

Congratulations on passing the test. Now, go to the Trial Cave and have a preacher named <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Daltanian</FONT> transfer you. If you want to be a Warrior or Machinist, go to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Meteor Pit</FONT>, or if you want to be a Mage or Shaman, go to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Thunder Hill</FONT>.
Please try hard to pass the Trial.
Young one, you seem to have trained a lot. Would you like to become even better?
I'm ready to go!
I've had enough for now...
You have a very strong will. You'll become a great hero! Now, you have 4 paths to choose from <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Warrior</FONT>, <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Machinist</FONT>, <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Mage</FONT>, and <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Shaman</FONT>. Do you know what each path is like?
Could you tell me?
I know everything!
Don't worry. I'll explain each of the 4 jobs to you. Which of them are you interested in?
Warrior
Mage
Others
For a Warrior, their belief in obtaining Soul Power is through <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Justice and Courage</FONT>. By calming their spirit in the heat of battle and focusing, they can apply Soul Power to their  weapon. In order to maximize their skill's effects, Warriors wield heavy weapons. To defeat their enemies, they must become strong in both spirit and body.<PF>Warriors belong to the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Order of Masamune</FONT>. They always fight their enemies fair and square, and always stand at the front lines of battle. Therefore only those with guts and strength are able to become Warriors.<PF>So, you want to be a Warrior?
The sword is my destiny!
Let me think for a sec!
Okay. Being a Warrior is a job that requires Justice and Courage, so I need you to prove that you have the courage necessary to become one.<PF>There are Umbra called <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Little Frankens</FONT> in the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Trial Cave</FONT> to the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Northwest of Trial Field</FONT>, who love to do evil things. If you could get rid of them, I think the villagers here will be very thankful. If you succeed in this, it will prove that you have the courage and skill necessary to become a Warrior.
I'll prove it to you! I'm off!
Not my style, sorry.
Now please go and defeat <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Little Franken</FONT> in the cave.
Really? I thought you had potential, that's too bad.
Really? I thought you had potential, that's too bad.
When defeating Umbra, many choose to use physical attacks.  However, some Umbra cannot be defeated with simple melee.<PF>Basically, there are many types of Umbra. So, when faced with such a monster, you'll need the power of a Mage, the philosophy of the Sorcerer Society. They have the skill to convert Soul Power into attacks, and are thus especially good against Umbra with high Soul Power.<PF>Mages <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>are highly destructive</FONT>, and can even defeat enemies with one hit. They can deal damage to enemies without even approaching them, and though they do not have the strong spirit and body of a Warrior, they have unparalleled magic power, powered by their very will. So it is impossible to become a Mage without a powerful mind.<PF>So, you want to be a <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Mage</FONT>?
Yes!
Let me think for a sec
Very well. With such a strong will, I'm sure you'll make a great Mage. Let's test if you are actually worthy of being a age.<PF>In the monster's nest, <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Trial Cave</FONT> to the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Northwest of Trial Field</FONT>, there is a monster named <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Little Mr. Arlys</FONT>. These Umbra re such evil things. If you can defeat them, I will accept you as a Mage. Be wise in your journey...
Arlys? I think I ate there once
No way, it's not for me.
I can sense your intelligence from your eye. Now go inside the cave and defeat <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Little Mr. Arly</FONT>.
I can't force you. But I think you are smart enough, and have the ability to pass the trial to become a Mage.
I can't force you, but I think you are smart enough and  have the ability to pass the trial to become a <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Mage</FONT>.
So what are you interested in?
Shaman
Machinist
Let me think for a sec.
Harmony with nature, this is the philosophy of the Nature Collective. One must be born with sensitivity to communicate with nature. Shamans basically require this instinctive skill.<PF>Shamans are the mediators between the Natural and Biological Worlds, using <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Soul Power</FONT> to weaken or strengthen a certain target's vitality. The Shaman's motto is to love nature and respect life.<PF>They don't carry weapons, and their strongest source of strength is their serenity with nature. The most important quality of a Shaman is an empathetic and loving personality.<PF>So, you want to be a <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Shaman</FONT>?
I sense beauty around us!
Let me think for a sec.
Excellent. Such a quick response. I see your heart is truly set on this. Well then, let me see if you are truly suited to being a Shaman.<PF>In the monster's nest, <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Trial Cave</FONT> to the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Northwest of Trial Field</FONT>, there are monsters named <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Little Mr. Arly</FONT>. These Umbra are such evil things. If you can defeat them, I will accept you as a <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Shaman</FONT>.
I'm on my way!
Whoa, not interested.
You seem to be confident. Now go and defeat <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Little Mr. Arly</FONT> in the cave.
Alright, lets meet again. Let me say one thing, I think you have natural talent. If you just had the will, I don't think there would be a problem.
Alright, lets meet again. Let me say one thing, I think you have natural talent. If you just had the will, I don't think it was a problem.
Mm? The path of science and discovery? Yes, there are people out there who dedicate their lives to invention.<PF>These people excel in <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Neo Machina</FONT>. They believe that everything in this world can be explained through science, even Umbra.<PF>However, many of them aren't particularly athletic, and don't have the skills to properly defend themselves. So they, when faced with an enemy, develop weapons that will allow them to fight from a distance, getting the upper hand in combat. This allows them to defeat the Umbra without putting themselves at risk. As a result, they are known as <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Machinists</FONT>.<PF>So, you want to be an Machinist?
E=MC squared, I'm in!

Tiny Umbra, no problem!

Congratulations! You finished the test!
Map Info, please
I can get around fine!
What do you want to know about the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Map</FONT>?
Map Summary
Small Map
Mark Location
Firstly, you have to learn how to open the Map.
How can I open the Map?
It is easy. Just click on the little map on the top of your screen. The icon is on the right side. Of course, you can use a hotkey, 'M' to open the map.
What does map say?
You can know the topography and the location of entrance to another map. If you're in a party, you can see where your party members are. Of course, there is a function to<FONT COLOR=#00ff00> Memorize Location</FONT> via large map.
What does this do?
This is another instruction, you can read it later!
Small map is set to open, it is located on the upper right corner!
What are these buttons?
These buttons affect Map and Zoom options!
What do the color buttons do?
Magnifying Glass?
+ and -?
Got it!
Red, green, yellow and blue buttons are set to open, then close on the second click. They are monster (red), non-player character (green), teammate (yellow) and player (blue). When they are active, you will find them on the map.
Like I said, you just select the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Magnifying Glass icon</FONT>, and you can open the large map and click again to close it!
Also, you can tell day and night from the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Sun</FONT> and <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Moon</FONT> icon.
This is Zoom. Click on + and it will zoom in, and clicking on - will zoom out.
Also, <FONT COLOR=#ffad5b>if you move your mouse on the small map</FONT> to the place you want to go and right click</FONT>, <FONT COLOR=#ffad5b>your spirit will guide you all the way there</FONT>.
About this <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Memorize Location</FONT> function, it allows you to bookmark your favorite locations, you get one  default set and you can <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>expand up to 20 sets</FONT>. Using this transportation function requires  <FONT COLOR=#ffad5b>a certain item</FONT>.
How do I expand it?
If you want to expand memory, you need to go to the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>ItmeMall</FONT> to buy <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Transportation Expansion Scrolls</FONT>. It helps you a lot, although you don't have to buy it.
You just mentioned medium...
Yeah, transportation will use <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>one Saved Point Transmission Scroll</FONT>. If you want you can go to the  <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>ItmeMall</FONT> to buy.
Wow, I can't wait!
Orientation is very important!
It's hard, are you ready?
Absolutely!
Hold on...
Then you can find me later, ok?
Ok, later.

How's are you doing? Do you want to learn about Items?
Yes! Tell me about items!
Check your backpack
What do you want to learn about <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>item</FONT>?
Item Interface Overview
Item explanation
Storage space
Put on/take off outfit
I don't wanna learn anything!
Click on the Spirit Button on <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>the bottom of your screen</FONT>. Then choose <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>item</FONT> from the menu. Also, you can just press <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>B</FONT> on your keyboard.
What's next?
When you want to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>move</FONT> an item to a different page, you can just <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>drag and drop</FONT> the  item icon to the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>page tag</FONT> at the top of the window.<PF>Alternatively, if you drag the icon to the page tag and hold it there, you will switch to that page, so you can drop the item into an <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>empty slot</FONT>.
What if the bag is full?
Well, you can put the stuff you don't need to carry in a storehouse. What I want to teach you now  is how to clean up your backpack and make money.
Oh! Show me how!
Basiclly, you can find <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Weapon Store</FONT> or <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>weapon store boss</FONT>. They are business man. Remember, the boss will not trade for you. Only will trade for <FONT COLOR=#ffad5b>himself</FONT>. Do not trade with a wrong person!
When selling items, drag and drop the item you want to sell onto the window 1 shown above. Then a confirmation window like Window 2 will show. Item you sold will not come back so check it here before you sell it.
Every items have detail information, so you should know them before making any decisions!
How can I look details?
First, you right click on the item (equipped or in bag) and you will see its status and details.
For example, <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>[Unable to drop]</FONT> (can't discard it), <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>[Unable to sell]</FONT> (can't sell at stores)</FONT>, <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>[Untradeable]</FONT> (can't trade with other players) and so on.
What is Lock?
Good eyes! This <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Lock</FONT> is for some unfortunate, unlucky, and un...
Ok, just say it!
Ok, if your account was stolen, or you don't want your friend to use your account, this is handy because you can set your password on it. But I don't recommend you to share an account with your friend, anyway.
You can store your items in both your backpack and storage. Did you know that?
Obviously not
Yeah, if you want to use storage, you need to find a <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Storage Manager</FONT>.
What can I store in storage?
Almost everything you want to. Also, you should know that there is a <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>public storage</FONT> tab where  you can exchange items with your other characters!
Using Equipment is easy to learn. After you open your item, double click on it or drag its icon to your equipment window and there you go! But remember, there will be a profession limitation.
Are you sure you're alright?
Oh... Not good. My bag has a hole! I think I need a new one...
I wish my bag is bigger......    Oh, hello, I didn't see you coming. What's up?
I heard you teach something
You like your bag, don't you?
Oh! Did Kikibiassa tell you? Come to see me later. I need to clean it up....
Yeah, I like it.

About skills
No Thanks
What part do you want to learn about <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Skill</FONT>?
Skills summary
Learn, use, forget
How to use skills
No need, thanks
First, let's talk about how to open the Skills window.
"You can push the Spirit Button, then click Skill or push <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>S</FONT> to open the skills window.		NPC(?雅/NPCP0001.tga)	Quest	Quest.XML	9.Text4"
Found it!
Yeah, let me explain these numbers one by one, ok?
They are <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>time usage</FONT>, <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>MP usage</FONT> and <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>SP usage</FONT>. The small book on the right is <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>the estimate total SP usage</FONT>, and on the bottom is <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>target</FONT>. If the skill does not match the target, you can't use it.
Lets talk about these three buttons on the left. The left one is <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Learn</FONT>. You have to make sure your level and spirit is high enough to learn the skill.
Do I need to forget skills?
Yes, because the maximum number of skills for a character is <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>50</FONT>, you can't have more if you reach the limit unless you forget some skills, or go to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>ItmeMall</FONT> and buy tools such as the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Sacred Mountain Flower</FONT> to extend the limit.
You can learn the skill again if you have enough spirit.
How do I use skills?
It is possible by pressing the button in the middle, but also you can assign a shortcut key. I will tell you later.
The middle button at the bottom of the skill window has the function to use the chosen skill.
Do I need it opened?
No, you can drag your favorite skills to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>the hotkeys on the bottom right</FONT>, and then you can use them easily.
It's up to you whether coming to study or taking tests...
Alright! I hope you become a Hero!
Hey! What's up?
I heard you are an instructor!
Lava's backpack...
Yeah, I can share some tips I learned from the skills handbook.
Oh, I hate to see people distracted.

young one Tarisha onversation
Lebant is just the one who taught me how to open the Umbra Guide. Fortunately, I am clever  enough to help myself on the rest of it.
I want to review again
Do you still love Lebant?
You want to learn <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Umbra Guide </FONT>or <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Quest Log</FONT>?
Learn Umbra Guide first
Learn Quest Log first
Well then, let's both do our best! I hope that someday my Adventure Log becomes full, and I could tell my children and  grandchildren about them. Or maybe talk about it when I'm hanging out with friends.
How do I open Umbra Guide?
You probably know nothing about Umbra Guide. Push the Spirit Button, you will find that the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Umbra Guide</FONT> is greyed out. After Lebant teaches you about the book, this button will be active, and then you  can open the Umbra Guide. You can also push <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>V</FONT> key to open it!
What's inside it?
You will see categories, and when you get a ew monster card, its name will appear. Its level and card number will appear as well.
Click on one of the cards and you will see the monster's picture, level, description and card  number.
Let's go back to first page of the Umbra Guide. At the bottom of the window, you will see <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>page number</FONT>, <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>number of cards collected</FONT>, and buttons to switch between <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Umbra Guide</FONT> and <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Magic Square</FONT>.
What are they?
We have already talked about <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Umbra Guide</FONT> layout so I will explain about <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Magic Square</FONT>.
<FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Magic Square</FONT> is very useful too. The part that is numbered one is <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>card list</FONT>, the one in the middle is <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>the button to change card's functions</FONT>, the part that is numbered 2 is where you want to set your card layout.
And on the bottom left side is the effect summary of the layout.
Of course, you can add or remove cards as you like. When you change the magic card layout, it will affect the amount of SP you will use.
What's the difference?
The current layouts include Follow, Battle Summon, and Magic Cards.     <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Follow</FONT> is for bringing the Umbra ith you. <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Battle Summon</FONT> is for summoning a monster during battle <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Magic Card</FONT> is for increasing your power through the combination of cards.   Use your cards wisely!
What is fast summon...?
Yeah, you are smart kid. Let's go back to the first page of Umbra Guide. When you open a monster card, there is a unction called <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>fast summon</FONT>.
If you use<FONT COLOR=#00ff00> fast summon</FONT>, you will <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>use 2 monster cards</FONT>. Also, fast summon only apply to the Umbra rom<FONT COLOR=#00ff00> battle summon</FONT>.
What about MMagnifying Glass?
Smart as a hip--that's next on the list!
When you open a monster card, there will be a Magnifying Glass icon.
You can check out your monster by rotating it!
Isn't the Umbra Guide very interesting?
I forgot what I wanted to say... I'll let you know when I remember.
Quest Log keeps records of the tasks you completed. It includes the quests with experience and money rewards, quests in the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Meteor Pit</FONT> and <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Thunder Hill</FONT>, <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>everyday quests</FONT> from those organizations, and many others!
Where can I see it?
Sorry, I skipped. First of all, how to open quest log. Push Spirit Button on the left, then click Quest button to open it. Or you can simply press <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>T</FONT>  to open quest log.
What's inside it?
The first block on the top allows you to switch between <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>on going quests</FONT> and <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>completed  quests</FONT>. You can also look up the current tasks and completed tasks here. The maximum number of quests for a haracter is <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>50</FONT>.
In the next window under it, you can see its descriptions.
There are two buttons in block 3, one is <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Cancel Quest</FONT>, and the other one is <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Quest Instruction</FONT>. If you are not familiar with the quest, you can cancel it or you can <FONT COLOR=#ffad5b>Forget the quest</FONT>, <FONT COLOR=#ffad5b>and restart it</FONT>.  The hotkey for the quest instruction is <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>R</FONT>.
Understood!
Don't you have questions about the close button?
Close is close right?
Yeah, you are right.
Yeah, I invited<FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Meteor Pit</FONT>'s <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Roarin</FONT> and <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Ofilia</FONT> to paint a portrait and bake a cake. Wonder if he likes it.
There's a lot more to remember.
......quest log and Umbra Guide.
Lebant is just the one who taught me how to open the Umbra Guide. Fortunately, I am clever enough to figure out the rest.
You're an instructor?
Enjoy talking to yourself?
Yeah, I can share my research about Umbra Guide and the Quest Log, come find me later!
What's wrong with talking to myself?

Oh its you? I'm really saved, thanks. After that evil <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Soul Eater</FONT> vanished, the other Umbra disappeared too.
Young one, you... your power seems to be at such a higher level than I expected. Maybe you may be able to grant my wish. There's been one thing that has been bothering me all this time, but now that I'm old, there's nothing I can do myself. Would you like to know my wish?
Sure.
No thanks!
I told you that the reason I am a watcher here is to get revenge, right? Even now, 50 years since that day, the sight of my ravaged village and dead brother are burned into my eyes, still haunting me. That was the first time I felt my knees quake at the sight of the Umbra...one in particular. <PF>The other day, I was finally able to find and challenge that monster, but it was futile. I almost died there. I tried several times since, but I just can't defeat him. I suspect that he knows this, and merely toys with me...<PF>I don't know if I'm just too weak, or if fear holds me back, but I can't do it no matter how many times I try. Young one, could you defeat it and help avenge my brother?
Leave it to me!
Perhaps later...
Young one, how could I ever thank you. The skeleton is called a <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Soul Eater</FONT>, and he is a truly powerful opponent, so please be careful. One piece of advice though, there are many other scary Umbra around there besides the Soul Eater, so it would be safer to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>take 3 or more friends with you</FONT>.
Well, its not something easy to do. Come back when you change your mind.
That's too bad. I'll have to find another person.
Thanks for helping out last time young one. I have one <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>warning</FONT> for you, If you value your life, don't go deep into the cave. There are tons of strong Umbra called <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Soul Eater</FONT> living there.
Young one, you seem to be pretty tough. Seems like I have to give this job to the new generation. Do you know why I'm here?
Enlighten me.
Not interested.
Oh, well, I'll have to start with a certain disaster from <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>50 years ago</FONT>. At the time, I was still a beginner like you...<PF>I will never forget that cold winter night. When I came back from the excursion, the village was under attack. Terrifying creatures that  should never be, their very forms were a violation of nature. The Umbra. They appeared out of nowhere, destroyed the village, taking most of the people's lives with it. There were virtually none who survived the onslaught, including my own <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>brother</FONT>.<PF>In my agony, I vowed to find whoever did this and take revenge for my brother.<PF>Through research I found that those monsters had come from <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Trial Cave</FONT>. However, I was unable to track their roots, and was only able to  form a force field to seal them in. Ever since I saw the endless monsters in the cave, I became a <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>protector</FONT>, defending <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Beginner's Village</FONT> from any monsters that find their way out.<PF>This is my job. However, it would seem I've grown old. My body can no longer keep up. Can you defeat the monsters inside in my place?
I'm ready to take over.
That's not my business!
Thank you, young one. Enter the cave and defeat <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Dratch</FONT> to weaken their forces once and for all.
*Sigh* Time tends to make us forget all too quickly... Your generation barely knows about that tragedy.
...be careful. Don't enter the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>cave</FONT> again. Inside, there are tons of <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>ferocious</FONT> Umbra sealed.
Young one, no matter how much you desire, with your current skills, it is just too <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>dangerous</FONT> for you to proceed. Don't enter yet...

The courage of certain beings allows them to obtain 'Soul Power' from their inner strength as a kind of silent prayer, and use weapons that are blessed with 'Soul Power' to fight Umbra. These people are Warriors. Are you one of them? Do you know where Soul Power comes from?
Belief!
A backpack!
Correct! 'Belief' is the source of Soul Power! Are you ready?
I am ready!
Give me a minute...
Knives, swords, and axes that are blessed...no, empowered, by Soul Power are the common weapons of a Warrior. I heard that <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Holy Plain</FONT> <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>a?瞽Fa??a癒禮瞽Da癒M?a?癒X</FONT>owns <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>a?瞽Fa??a瞽G'</FONT> a??a癒M? <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>a?瞽X-?c?3</FONT> , if you can give them to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>a?癒禮?瞿ga-癒Ma?'?癒Pc3癒?</FONT>, he can make it to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>a?瞽X-?a癒V癒簣</FONT>. a?瞽X-?a癒V癒簣 is my dream. Please help me.
So you are not brave enough to prove yourself! I hope you can find your courage! Come on, young Warrior!
So you do not know your profession very well. Warrior's spirit comes from 'Belief'! You disappoint me!
Those who obtain Soul Power by using magic, and use this awesome power to fight Umbra are Mages. You harness this energy and combine it with unique spells to get Soul Power from nature. Am I right, Mage?
Mastery of Mana leads to insight.
Man, what?
You seem to know very well about your profession. But do you have the courage to prove yourself?
I am ready!
Give me a minute...
I know what you do with bats, but I have special feeling about bats! Especially about <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>bats</FONT> there are very precious <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>bat wings</FONT>, can you bring one to me? Incidentally, they are also quite tasty...
You seem not to have enough courage to prove yourself! I hope you find your inner mana mojo! Come on, young Mage!
You seem not to know your profession very well. You disappoint me!
Those who feel a connection with nature and obtain Soul Power from meditation. They use this to build life and spread a message of eternal peace throughout the land. They are known as Shamans. They understand nature, and thus, can direct certain forces to do their bidding. Shamans can weaken targets by reducing their Soul Power directly...and yet, you don't kill, you only drain them,, leaving them for the earth. Am I right, Shaman?
The Serenity of Nature calms us all.
Huh? Was that a joke?
You seem know very well about your profession. But do you have courage to prove yourself?
I am ready!
Give me a minute...
Since Shamans love nature, I heard that in <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Holy Plain</FONT> there are a group of <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Blue Demon</FONT> are corrupting the landscape. What are you going to do about them? Please get 5 <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>their Confession Letters</FONT> to prove your power!
Young medium, come on! Prove yourself!
You don't seem know your profession well. You disappoint me!
Those who use sheer mental brilliance to gain Soul Power are Machinists. This is manifested in their amazing creations, from weaponry to the Hunter Stone. Machinists believe in facts. They believe that the Umbra are collection of weak souls and can be destroyed by powerful machines. They invented long distance weapons to avoid close quarters fights. Am I right, machinist?
Absolutely
What did you say?
Great! Do you have courage to prove yourself?
I am ready!
Give me a minute...
I hope to live a better life. I decide to lose weight! I heard in <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Holy Plain</FONT> there is a <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>twin mummy</FONT> whose <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>tough skin</FONT> can help you to lose weight! Can you bring <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>3 pieces</FONT> to me?
I don't think you can make it. And I am not fat!
I am so disappointed! You seem to know nothing about yourself!
These Umbra are getting more and more wild!
Reno basic conversation
In the town, a guy named <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Mr. Xiao</FONT>! He's been hysterical all day...
What's wrong?
It does nothing with me...
I heard that he is haunted by a Umbra. He loses control of himself and scares his own pregnant wife.
Really?
I'd better stay away!
Right! He often berates his wife because of the evil spirits! You should visit <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Mrs. Xiao</FONT>some time. She is so poor...
I am so disappointed!
You are so cruel!
I don't sleep well lately!
What can I do for you?
I have nothing to do with it!
It is all because of <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Dirt Umbra Kid</FONT> crying at midnight and touching my left foot to wake me! I want to teach them a lesson! Can you help me?
No problem!
Yes...try counting sheep!
Head to the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Holy Plain</FONT> and help me get rid of these pesky Umbra! <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Bring 3 bunches of their hair</FONT>, so that I can scare them away for good! That'll show them!
Counting sheep? I used to count till 10000!
Oh...ok...whatever...
Can you help me?
Yep. I'm on it!
Yea, no. Get your own hair.
Please help me to deliver this <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Mine Stone</FONT> to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Rolio</FONT>... Thank you so much!
He's a stone's throw away!
Uhh..it's too heavy for me!
Give this <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Mine Stone</FONT> to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Rolio</FONT>. Please take good care of it!
Ok, I am disappointed!
A stone? Heavy? Wow...I thought you trained!
I just took a nap and lost my <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Jade</FONT>!
Have you noticed anything?
Just buy a new one!
I was about to fall asleep and saw <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>something like an orange candy...or a so-called freezing team</FONT> approaching me. I slept eventually. But after I woke up I found that my <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Jade was gone</FONT>!
Let me find it for you!
Oh, it's no problem.
The thief must be that <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>something like an orange candy... or so called freezing team</FONT>. Please help me!
No! I will bring it back!
No way! This jade is like my wife! I even cuddle it at night...
Lately, the residents here formed an <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Umbra Bursting team</FONT>..or was it a Umbra busting team? I can't remember, all I know is they ain't afraid of no ghosts! I want to donate something to them. Can you help me?
Will be great if it's within my ability!
Just mail them a pear. A ripe one.
Umbra busters! They need courage and wisdom...they also need a good leader, since the last one never recovered from that giant marshmellow. So I want to give them <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>a crown</FONT> for <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>their leader</FONT>, however I lost the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Umbra busting diamond</FONT>. So I need your help. <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>The Umbra busting diamond</FONT> is made of <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Umbra</FONT> tear drops. You can only get them by killing the Umbra... Thank you, and good luck.
Bustin makes me feel good!
Whoa, Umbras? I'm out!
<FONT COLOR=#00ff00>The Umbra busting diamond</FONT> is made of <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Umbra</FONT> tear drops. You can only get them by killing Umbra... They have been seen in <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Plague Dungeon 1</FONT> ... Thank you so much!
Then you won't help me?
A Pear? Pears have nothing to do with Umbra hunting!
Iron smithing is such an enjoyable and interesting job!
Romeo basic conversation
A nice man...ya? Are you the nice man helping me to gather herbs last time?
Yeah, it's me alright!
Lalalala--can't hear you!
May I ask you for a favor again?
Yeah, of course!
Who are you?
I just picked up a bunch of flowers for my Juliet, but was robbed by <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Twin Mummies</FONT> from the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Holy Plain</FONT>! Please help me to get them back... It was a bouquet of <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>10</FONT>! Thank you so much...
I... am... Romeo...
How did I miss that?
I disappointed Juliet! My flowers made her allergic!
Then, what could be done next?!
LOL, girls want gems, not flowers.
I heard that if you pull off some of <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Pumpkin Freezing Team's</FONT> hair...I mean their 'Pumpkin' vines, they can cure<FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Flower Allergies</FONT>, I wonder if you can help me get <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>5 </FONT> <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Pumpkin Vines</FONT> ok?
Yeah, of course!
No. I am very busy!
Pumpkin Freezing Team usually appears at <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Saint Field</FONT>. Please help me get <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>5 pieces of</FONT> their <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Pumpkin Vines</FONT> <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>and give them to Juliet</FONT> to cure her flower allergy... Thank you so much!
Ok...work on your own business, but when you have time don't forget to help me, ok?
This is a very serious condition! You must have some therapy!
I just heard that <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Blade Raccoon Dog</FONT> is planning to attack our village in 3 days! What should we do?
What's wrong?
My name's Joan and you're on your own!
Raccoon Dog has a habit. When their <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Silver Blade</FONT> becomes dull, they will attack a village. Human blood helps sharpen their blades, you see. The Blade Raccoon Dogs love their blades more than their lives. If you take one of their blades, the rest will run away...
Then, what can I do for you?
I gotta go if you don't need me
We should take their blades and scare them first! If... you can help us get <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>5 of</FONT> <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Blade Raccoon Dog's</FONT> <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Silver Blades</FONT>, we will hang the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Blade</FONT> in front of our village. If they see them, <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>they will run away</FONT>, and be gone forever!
Ok! I will help you guys!
I'd rather have a rest!
Blade Raccoon Dogs are around <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Holy Grace Church 1F</FONT>. Please help us get <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>5 of</FONT> <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Blade Raccoon Dog's</FONT> <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Silver Blade</FONT> . We will hang the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Blade</FONT> in front of our village. If they see them<FONT COLOR=#00ff00>they will run away</FONT>...
I am so disappointed! How can rest be more important than the lives in the village? Juliet lives there too!
... I thought you would be happy to help us... Never thought you would run away! I am so disappointed!
... I really hoped I could give you some useful help...
Brave soul... I am glad to see you! You always help me when I am in trouble. Thank you so much!
Do you need any help?
You're welcome, bye bye!
Since you know me so well, I will just be frank with you...
Yeah, of course!
Why do I have to help you?
I was moved when Juliet gave me the garment she made. I think I will give her a gift for her to remember me...
What can I do for you?
Why do I have to help you?
I want to make a 'Deep Sea Star' necklace for her. But, er, I don't have a 'Deep Sea Star'. <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Deep Sea Star is made of Water Spider's tear drops</FONT>. Can you please help me get <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>one</FONT> <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Deep sea star</FONT>? Water Spiders are around <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Holy Grace Church 1F</FONT>. Thank you so much!
Sorry... I did not intend to bother you... I am sorry!
Alright... You already said that... How could I ask you for more help...
Ah... Please... I need your help again... Don't leave...
My father gave me an impossible mission yesterday... I have no idea what to do!
What mission is it?
It does nothing with me...
All this was because of <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Demon Spiders</FONT>! My father was passing by <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Holy Grace Church 1F</FONT> once upon a time. Demon Spiders attacked him. My father's sword couldn't cut through their skin but was broken. My father passed the sword to me and hope me to fix it. But it is very difficult...
What's up again? I can help!
Oh, then, you keep working!
Thank you for helping me. The only way to stop them is to go to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Holy Grace Church 1F</FONT> , and find <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Demon Spider's</FONT> <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Spit</FONT>! You are the only one can help!
I think you still have something to do. No problem! I am willing to wait for you right here. Could you please help me when your stuff is done?
... I really hoped I could give you something to help you in your training...
Oh, poor Juliet... Poor Juliet!
Juliet basic conversation
Spring is the most lively season! But in <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Saint Field</FONT> , all the plants are sleeping... There must be something wrong...
What's wrong?
It does nothing with me...
It is all because of <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>evil wolfman</FONT>! It cursed the land with its blood! Only if we get its <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>hair</FONT>, and throw the powder that is made of the hair to the land. Then the plants will be saved!
Please let me contribute my help!
I gotta go if you don't need me
Thank you for willing to save this land. Please go to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Saint Field</FONT> and get <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>10 pieces of evil wolfman's hair</FONT> for me... Be careful!
... I really hoped I could give you something to help you in your training...
... I really hoped I could give you something to help you in your training...
There is a dangerous adventure ahead... Oh... My Romeo... I wish you can help me to complete this mission! I know that our love will give you power! But... I can't wait too long... I am dying...
What can I do for you?
Boy crazy! Don't waste my time...
Please go to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Holy Plain</FONT> to inform my <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Romeo</FONT>... to hurry up and come back soon... I am dying...
Oh... My Romeo...
I want to sew a coat for Romeo. Then, he could feel my warmth all the time.
Ya, this is great!
Eeh...stop it!
I want to make a perfect garment by weaving 'Water Spider's' Water Silk! But Water Spiders guard their silk with their lives. So <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>you'll have to defeat Water Spiders first</FONT>! Are you willing to help me with this difficult task?
I'd love to do that!
I have something to do!
Please go to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Holy Grace Church 1F</FONT> to get <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>3 pieces of</FONT> <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Water Spider's</FONT> <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Water Silk</FONT>. Thank you so much!
Alright... I am right here waiting for you! Don't forget me when you are done!
Love is timeless! If you do want to set a time limit for love...then, it should be a million years!
Hey! Thank you for getting me Water Silk last time. So I could make this comfortable cloth! Just... I need another favor from you... I wonder...
No problem!
I am very busy!
Although the garment is completed, it would be better with some decorations. Can you go to the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Holy Plain</FONT> to find <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Romeo</FONT>, ask him about the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Flame Medal</FONT> and bring me one. Thank you!
Alright... Thank you anyways!
When can I stop being sad? Romeo...
Granny Min
I am so old that every inch of my body hurts!
What can I do for you?
It does nothing with me...
Could you please help me find a doctor named 'Brodosky' in 'Map D', whose medical bandages can cure those pains? Please get 2 pieces for me!
No problem!
Ah... I forgot... I need to take care of something else...
Remember his name is 'Brodosky' in 'Map D'. I'll be waiting!
Those young people...
... I really hoped I could give you some useful help...
Young one... Could you please send this meal to my grandson?
Alright!
Not a big deal missing a meal...
Please help me deliver the order to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Map E</FONT> to my grandson, <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Belchif</FONT> he is a blacksmith trainee... Thank you so much!
Says who! Kids need food to grow up!
Young man... Thank you for help me so many times, but I still need one more help from you, may I?
Yeah, of course!
Ah? What...sore!
I just realized that my grandson ask me to find his classmate <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Elena</FONT> to borrow a book named <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Spirit Control</FONT>. Can you find it for me?
Alright...
I want to cook meatloaf for my guests, but I don't have enough <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Meat</FONT>, can you go to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Saint Field</FONT> to get some meat for me?
Yeah, of course!
What did you say? Oh...Bye bye!
Yeah, find <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Blade Raccoon Dog in Saint Field</FONT>, its Raw meat is perfect for meatloaf... Please buy <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>5 dollars of Raw meat</FONT>back.
Never mind...
I am old... Everything will go back to dirt... I am not afraid. It is merely a journey that we must all take.
Jin Kun basic conversation
Can you help me? Juliet came to me yesterday and said that <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Romeo</FONT> is sick recently! I wonder if you can take my <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>air tube</FONT> to the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Holy Plain</FONT> to collect a sample of <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Romeo's</FONT> breath and bring it back to me?
Alright!
When I have time...
Thank you so much! please remember that the air tube can only stay pure for<FONT COLOR=#00ff00>5 mins</FONT>so you need to get back<FONT COLOR=#00ff00>in 5 mins</FONT>! Be careful!
Alright! I know you are busy...take care...
Being a doctor is so tough!
Something happened to you?
No way! You think too much!
Last night, there was a drunk... No, a <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>confused man</FONT>, but then I realized it was really a <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Bronze zombie</FONT> who came to me for a drink! Outrageous! But I am just a doctor and don't have liquor. Then he just took away my <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Whole bottle of lodine</FONT> and drank all of it! I can't work without lodine. can you please help me to get it back, even if you have to beat it out of him!
Sure. Although, I'll say one thing--this is by far, the weirdest task that anyone's asked of me yet. Seriously, a drunk zombie? What's next?
Next time, I will help you!
Believe me, you haven't seen anything yet. Moving on, the one who took my <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Iodine</FONT> lives in <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Fujin's Field</FONT>, and he's named <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Bronze Zombie</FONT>. Please help me get it back!
I just need a small favor... So disappointed!
Sigh... You don't know my situation...
Last night, I dreamed two <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>River Kids</FONT> crying and telling me that they just touched <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Blade Raccoon Dog's</FONT> but...it robbed their water hat. <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Without the Water hat, the River kids lose their magic</FONT>, and they might die!
So...?
I hate Umbra!
Please help me! Go to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Blade Raccoon Dog</FONT> and get the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Water hat</FONT>. It will teach the river kids a lesson!
Oh... Alright!
I am busy right now! Next time!
Please go to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Saint Field</FONT> and find <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Blade Raccoon Dog</FONT> and get <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>the Water hat</FONT> back!
Oh... Forget it then...
oh... Alright! I won't bother you anymore...
People say that men can turn into zombies if they are infected by zombies or if they are buried next to a zombie. There was a governor here whom the villagers hated and buried him without caution. He turned into a zombie later and revenged on the villagers by infecting people. The number of zombies are increasing quickly... What should we do?
How can I help you then?
I'd rather get away...
Zombies are afraid of sun light. Maybe we can use <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Mirror</FONT> to reflect sun light on them. I think it will work...
What can I do then?
Ask someone else!
<FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Mirror</FONT> can be found in <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Fujin's Field</FONT> where <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Demonic Mirror</FONT> lives... Please help me bring <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>5 pieces</FONT> back. I want to give them to the villagers to protect themselves...
Alright!
Never thought you are such a coward!
After halloween, Pumpkins were thrown away as trashes. They gathered later and decided to change their image. They learned after snowman and doubled as 4 pieces a group. They hope people could look at them differently.
This is great...
It's none of my business...
But there is a sense of hatred among those Pumpkins, which changed their original intention. They are now rebellions!
What can I do then?
Forget it! You never knew it!
Rebellious <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Pumpkin Totem</FONT> ate <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Satanic crystal</FONT>! And <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Satanic crystal</FONT> generate poison in their body that cause Pumpkins lose their mind and start to rebel, revenge and do something bad... So, please bring me <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>five</FONT> <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Satanic crystal</FONT> for experiment. If you can give me a period of time, I think I can produce the potion to solve the problem. Please bring them back to me...
No! This is not my style! Protecting the natural environment is my duty!
You can't just take the face value! Sigh... I will talk to you later when I have time!
You have to learn how to love yourself before you want to love someone else! How can you love someone when you don't even love yourself?
Elena basic conversation
My mom once told me a very touching true story. I really hope one day I could change the situation to help the poor kid to get back his lost memory...
I can help you with that!
Sigh... So much trouble
My mom told me once that there was a big fire in the village 50 years ago. A young mother with a twins sacrificed herself to save her children even though they were badly burned. And even worse, the evil wolf found them, <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>it ate their memory crystal</FONT> and escaped. The twins grew up without knowing their mother. They are very good brothers but hate the world...
What can I do then?
It's just a memory lost!
You are such a kind man! I wonder if you can get <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>The memory crystal</FONT> back to the twins. It is such a wonderful thing to do!
I'll take care of this!
I don't do small business!
Thank you so much! Please remember that <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>The memory crystal </FONT> is taken by the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Evil Wolf</FONT>! The Evil Wolf usually appears in <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Saint Field</FONT>... Thank you so much!
You have no heart! You are not a nice person!
You are so cold-hearted! I disgust you!
Soft-hearted is better than cold-hearted!
Annoying! Annoying! Annoying!!
Annoying? What is it?
Annoying? I am leaving then...
When I was sleeping last night, I felt something touch my face... Then I woke up in the morning and found that my book is gone! I probably know who stole my book. Can you help me get it back?
Sure
Next time, I will help you!
It must be the guy who lives in <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Fujin's Field</FONT> and is named <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Crazy paperman</FONT> ! They like to disguise them by bookmarks and steal books... Name of my book is <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Religion summary</FONT>. Please help me get it back!
I just need a small favor... So disappointed!
I am not annoyed by you! Please don't go...
I am so unlucky lately!
What's wrong?
Anger makes people getting old! Ha ha ha!
It is all because of <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Stone Gargoyles</FONT> who live in <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Saint Field</FONT>... They can turn into <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Stone</FONT>... Even though they can't attack me in that form, I am very annoyed by them! I am often tripped by the stones. I hope to get rid of them! However, they are fearsome killers and follow the PenUmbra known as Soul Eater... They are very tough to deal with!
I wanna take a look!
Er...I gotta go now!
Great! Let me see...1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6... I have 7 bruises, so please kill 7 <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Saint Field</FONT> 's <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Stone Gargoyle</FONT>! They must pay!
Alright! I will leave you alone...
You are teasing me... I won't talk to you anymore!
Have you ever seen what a <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Blade Raccoon Dog</FONT> looks like?
You've never seen it before?
Who cares! I'm outta here!
<FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Blade Raccoon Dog</FONT>, they have blade paws and fly faster than wind! I have never seen their faces!
Do you want to see one?
I am busy right now! Later!
It is not that hard. Blade Raccoon Dog usually appears in <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Saint Field</FONT>. If you can <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>get BS stone from their bodies,</FONT> you can take a close look at them!
Alright!
Oh... Fine... I take back my question...
Have you ever heard that if you are bitten by an <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Evil wolf</FONT>, you will turn into it in full moon night?!
How does it look like?
It's none of my business...
They often appear in <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Saint Field</FONT>. They walk straight, have strong arms, sharp nails for attacking and the sometimes roar. They can easily jump away when they find their enemy is stronger.
Cowards!
I am not interested!
I am afraid of them... I wonder if you can help me...
No problem!
No! Ask someone else!
I heard that you could burn Evil wolf's palm hair and wear the ashes... Evil wolf won't come close to you. I wonder if you can go to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Saint Field</FONT> to pull <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>3 bunches of its hair</FONT>. I want to protect my mom and dad...
I don't know whom to go if you don't want to help.
It's ok...I am really scared...
Don't be so cold... It is not good!
I don't wanna go to school! NO!
Are you dreaming? Wake up!
Don't want to? Then, don't!
What do you want?
You didn't sleep well?
You slept like a pig...
Last night, those 4 in 1 Pumpkins were fighting for who's on top again. No one can sleep... I want to teach them a lesson!
Let me help you!
Go to bed earlier...
Do you really want to help me? The bunch of Pumpkins are called <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Pumpkin Freezing Team</FONT>! I saw them going to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Holy Plain</FONT>. Please help me <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>kill 10 groups of them</FONT>... And tell them that we'll use them for pumpkin pie if they keep making noise!
I must have payback...one day!
Sorry... I am really sleepy... I want to sleep...
Umbra Pumpkins... are...so annoying!
Mom said that I am the cutest... I want to be the cutest!
Mrs. Nina's conversation
People say that Snow woman was betrayed by a mountain god. Her grudge turned into thousands of <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Umbra</FONT>. Those Umbra look weak but are actually powerful! Their lives are all about revenge...
What should we do?
This is not my business...
Those Umbra that were created by Snow woman may look weak but are cruel as hell! They can freeze everything they see including humans!
Let me save the people!
oh...I gotta go now!
Thank you so much! Please kill <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>10</FONT> <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Umbra</FONT>! I hope they will be gone one day!
No problem!
Ask me when I have time
I heard that <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Umbra</FONT> are around <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Plague Dungeon1</FONT>! Please kill <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>10</FONT> of them!
Great. Please recruit more brave people to join us to kill Umbra...
I know you will be afraid too... Hopeless...
You are part of the world too... How can you be so ignorant? I am so disappointed.
I understand them as a woman... It is helpless... Killed by her lover... Only hatred left...
What should I do to help?
So terrifying!
Umbra come from the left memories, the memories that turned into <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>pieces</FONT>. They can't move one before forgetting them.
What should I do to help?
I am busy right now! Later!
I heard that if they bring <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>The memory fragments</FONT> back and pray on them, the Umbra would live in peace.
I want to help!
I'd rather give up
Please go to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Plague Dungeon</FONT> to get 6 pieces of <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Umbra's</FONT> <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Memory fragments</FONT> to me, and I will find the solution...
You also need a kind heart besides courage!
I knew you would say this! I am so disappointed!
Never thought you are such a coward!
Do you still remember the story about <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Snow woman</FONT> and <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Umbra</FONT>? Snow lady was betrayed by mountain god. Her grudge turns into thousands of Umbra. Those Umbra look weak but are actually powerful! Their lives are all about revenge...
Yeah... I remember this!
Don't remind me with bad memory
Thank you for cure the grudge of the Umbra... But there are still some <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Umbra turning into</FONT> <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Evil spirit</FONT>, whose grudge is much complicated than Umbra! The villagers all hope that you could help us again...
Good! Of course! I will!
I am busy...have to go!
Thank you! We have a plan for you which is fire! Just the fire is special...
No problem!
Ask me when I have time
It is from <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Plague Dungeon1</FONT> . There is a <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Dragon lamp</FONT> whose wick contains <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Original fire element</FONT>. You need to get <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>5 pieces of</FONT> <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Original fire element</FONT> back to me... Thank you so much!
Great! We will be waiting...
It seems that we expected too much from you... Sorry...
I don't know that your are still being haunted by the Umbra! Sorry...
Babies who live in poor condition are sad! Their parents often let them live on their own in the wild.
What about the kids?
I have nothing to do with it!
The babies that live in the wild are either starved or eaten or burned to death!
Where does the fire come from?
Don't lie to me! This is not true!
I believe that the unknown fire in the wild should be <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Umbra fire</FONT>. Umbra fire sometimes burns the land and those poor babies. The dead babies then turn into <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Dragon lamp</FONT> and are waiting for revenges...
What can we do?
I'd rather forget it!
Those <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Dragon lamp</FONT> are still young, so if you can destroy the grudge, they will be set free!
Then, what should I do to help them?
oh...I gotta go!
Thank you for your help! You need to go to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Plague Dungeon</FONT> and get 10 pieces of <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Dragon lamp</FONT>, and cure them. Everything will be fine then!
Why are you so cold? It's heartbreaking...
You also need kind heart besides courage!
This is real! I swear...
Never thought you are such a coward!
Where is my Magic dictionary? Have you seen it?
Do you need my help to find it?
I feel dizzy whenever I see a book!
The book contains the love letters that Rogosk wrote to me. A Paper kid sneaked in last night and took the book away! Can you help me find it? I can give him the book but the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>6</FONT> <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>love letters</FONT>. Can you help me get them back?
Yeah, of course!
Don't bother me! I am busy...
I heard that the Paper kid is <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Fujin's Field's</FONT> <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Crazy paperman's</FONT> body double. And those Crazy papermen like exchange their collections. So my love letters are probably in different places! Please help me get <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>6</FONT> <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>love letters</FONT> back... Thank you so much!
Oh... Fine... I have to find someone else to help, sorry!
Well... If you don't want to help... Just say it!
Umbra and demons are everywhere now! I don't know when is the end.
Henry basic conversation
I am pissed off! Do you know that <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Common people could gain wolf's power by wearing wolf's skin</FONT>?
Yeah...I heard that!
I don't care!
Women in the village told me that there are <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>3</FONT> <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Evil wolfman</FONT> around and attacks women. I believe that they are human with wolf skins! <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>They are sex predators</FONT>. Can you please help me?
What should I do?
Sorry, I am busy!
You are good man! But it is hard to tell fake wolves from real ones. Only if after they die, they will leave <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Dead wolf skin</FONT>... However, they are all bad!
I see! Then what?
I don't do small business!
Please go to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Saint Field</FONT> to find <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Evil wolfman</FONT> and kill them until you find 3 sex predators and get <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>3</FONT> of their <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Dead wolf skins</FONT> to comfort the women...
You have no heart! You are not a nice person!
Sigh...young people now are cold...
fine...forget it...
it's another sad story...
What is it?
I'd better stop talking...
Last night, a Umbra with wounds all over his body came to my house and told me a 300 years old story... A group of Stone Gargoyles attacked the village in a stormy night. They killed everyone including women and kids by <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Paper cut</FONT> whose spirits are still around till now.
What's Paper cut?
Is it edible?
<FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Paper cut</FONT> is cutting the victims bit by bit until they die. The Umbra and demons enjoy the game!
I want revenge!
I should stay away!
Great! In order to save them, you need <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>5 pieces of</FONT> <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Stone Gargoyles'</FONT> <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Powder</FONT> ! Thank you very much!
I am so disappointed!

Please don't leave...
Recently the poor kids are back! Such annoying!
What kids?
Rebellion? Put it down!!
A lot of kids died during the plague. Their poor parents have to put their bodies in the old castle where the vampires live. They turned the kids into vampires and call them <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Drapper</FONT>!
How can we stop them?
oh...I gotta go now!
If we could <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>get their Big Candy</FONT>maybe we can find a way to turn them back... Whatever, we need your help!
What should I do?
Ask me when I have time
Please get <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>3</FONT> pieces of <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Snail Big Candy</FONT> from <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Drapper</FONT> who live in <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Holy grace church</FONT> ! Remember it has to be Snail Lollipop!
Alright! I will leave you alone...
Alright! I will leave you alone...
They are dead already...what could we do?
It is time for spiders to reproduce...
Spiders? Reproduce?
Not my business...
Spiders are not so bad! But they produce hundreds of Earth Spiders who destroy everything! People are afraid of them!
Really? I want to take a look!
oh...I gotta go now!
<FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Earth Spiders</FONT>... are around <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Holy Grace Church 1F</FONT> if you can please get<FONT COLOR=#00ff00>5</FONT> <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Earth Spider's Fang</FONT> to me and I will ask brave men in the village to form a <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Anti-spider Army</FONT> !
No problem!
Ask me when I have time
<FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Earth Spiders</FONT> are around <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Holy Grace Church 1F</FONT>. Can you please get <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>5</FONT> <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Earth Spider's Fang</FONT> for me?
Alright! I will leave you alone...
Ok! If you are afraid, forget it...
I am very disappointed to see you don't care...
Can you do me a small favor?
No problem!
I am not interested!
Yesterday, when I was at <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Saint Field</FONT> fighting Umbra, my Bronze sword was broken! A group of <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Stone Gargoyles</FONT> came from nowhere and ate <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>The Ancient Copper Coins</FONT> and then escaped...
How can I help you?
I am busy right now! Later!
I have got 5 pieces of <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Ancient Copper Coins</FONT>. There are still <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>6 more</FONT> at <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Saint Field</FONT> in <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Stone Gargoyle's</FONT> stomach... Please help me!
Alright!
Oh... Fine... I take back my question...
Sorry, I am sorry, everyone...
What happened?
I am busy right now...
Spider... The Anti-spider army failed... The spiders <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>got new look</FONT> and became much tougher...
What? They got backup?
oh...I gotta go now!
Yes, they are <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Demon Spiders</FONT>... They came to help Earth Spiders! They have got my Bosses Ring which represents my leadership! Sigh...
I am willing to help!
Ask me when I have time
Really? please go to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Holy grace church 1F</FONT> to find <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Demon Spiders</FONT> and get my <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Bosses Ring</FONT>. Thank you so much!
Alright! I will leave you alone...
Ok! If you are afraid, forget it...
Sorry... Sorry! Sorry!
Umbra hunting is my holy duty. I must bust the Umbra! I must...
Thunder Hill Abdu
Best regards!
Hey, how are you doing? I have a job for you. Interested?
Listen carefully
Not interested
Great, I saved this job just for you. Here's the details: Dalifon wants to make some armor, and needs <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Mummy Bone</FONT>. He wants you to go to the Spiritual Land and get <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>5 Mummy Bones</FONT> from <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Flesh Wound Man</FONT>. How does that sound? They are tougher than those Little Mr. Leaf so I can't be held responsible if something bad happens.
Accept
Reject
Acting confident huh? You gave an answer right away; maybe you didn't even need to think about it. Alright, go to the Spiritual Land and defeat <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Flesh-Wound Man</FONT> and get <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>5 Mummy bones</FONT>.
I was counting on you... I thought you were braver.
Wow, you really seem to not like it. Alright, I'll do it myself. I was saving this job for you.
Hi, there's another job for you. Want to give it a try?
Why not!
Next time...
Great, now I can finally take a break. This was requested from Shuman. I'll explain it to you. I think you already know about the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Little Mr. Leaf</FONT> that appears in the fields near Thunder Hill? The <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Little Mr. Leaf</FONT> carries something used to make some products.<PF>Shuman asked me to get <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>5 Leaves of Treasure from Little Mr. Leaf</FONT> for him. I'll warn you though, unlike the previous job, this one is risky. What do you think?
Accept
Too dangerous
Alright, then can you go to the Spiritual Land and defeat a few <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Little Mr. Leaf</FONT> to obtain <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>5 Leaves of Treasure from Little Mr. Leaf</FONT>? Once you have five, come back to me.
Alright. I can't blame you. Life is a priority.
That's rude, I'll ask someone else.
Um... I do have a new job for you, but with your current ability I can't let you go.
We meet again. How are you doing? Interested in another job? We've worked together before, so this time your reward will be better.
Depends on my reward
With just that much...
Oh come on, it hurts my feelings when a friend is ungrateful. Anyway, this time its from Sonsi. He is uber busy right now and needs some help with a delivery. Can you help?
Accept
I don't want to smell sweaty
Alright take this package. Deliver it as soon as possible to Diba in the south side of the town.
Your inventory is full. Clean it up and come back.
Alright. I'll give this job to someone else.
How greedy.
I have another job for you, you want to do it?
Of course
I'm busy
Well then, let me explain the job to you.<PF>It's fairly simple. The Request Paper I had you take the other day had a request from the Union, so I want you to take this Union Church Member List to the soldiers to the Southeastern Prophet Council, then come back. That's it - easy, right?
That sounds easy
No way!
Alright, please hurry!
Your inventory is full. Clean it up and come back.
Alright, someone else will do it.
Alright, I'll find someone else.
Hey, can you do me a favor? I have a job that will pay well.
Tell me about it
No, thanks
It's not that bad. Oh, let me introduce myself first. I'm Abdu, I work as a broker. Get many jobs done quickly and obtain a brokerage fee. Usual jobs aren't too dangerous, so if you're interested let me know.<PF>Currently, I'm looking for someone to pick up paperwork from other places. I'm rather busy, and can't be everywhere at once. That's why I'm looking for someone to pick them up. Would you like to do this for me?
Accept
Reject
Ah, good! I want you to pick up some request form from Sonsi from magical goods store, Shuman from item store, guild master Chezla, and Dalifon of accessory store. Thanks. <PF>Oh, I forgot to tell you the location! The magical goods store is on the east side, the house with straw roof. The item store is on the west side with a straw roof. The guild office is a wooden house on the north east side. Lastly, the accessory store is on the south east side straw roof house. Please go quickly.
Oh? Seems like you didn't like this job.
Oh? Seems like you're too busy.
Thunder Hill Sonsi conversation
Oh, its you. If you find any magical goods you like, purchase them.
Oh, its you. There are other favors I want you to do, would you help me?
Sure
No, I'm busy
You've been to Spiritual Land right? People say that they've seen what we call <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Drowned Demon</FONT> near the south side. That monster is special and at rare times carries hard shell,  which is something we humans cannot get. I want you to defeat them and obtain <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>3 Hard shells</FONT>.
I thought I could rely on you, young one.
Oh great, you're strong and limber. Would you do me a favor? It may be simple, but I'll pay you well.
Here's the story. When I make magical goods, I use a special material called Heavens Bell Flower, but I'm out of stock. It can't be found in Thunder Hill.<PF>I've heard that <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Flame Lightning Spirits</FONT> eat this flower. I want you to go to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Spiritual Land</FONT> and  get <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Heavens Bell Flowers</FONT> from <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Flame Lightning Spirits</FONT>, can you do that?
Alright
No I can't
Alright, please go to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Spiritual Land</FONT> immediately and get <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>5 Heavens Bell Flowers</FONT> for me!
Do as you like!
Oh? Then I wont say anything more.
If you need magical goods, come take a look.
Thunder Hill Shuman conversation
Oh, thanks the other day.
Hello, you seem to have finished the job from the other day. I have a slightly dangerous job, do you want to take it?
Let me do it!
Um... I want to live
The materials needed to make potions are almost gone, at this rate we can't do business.<PF>I want you to collect <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Fairy Powder</FONT>. Fairy powder can be obtained from <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Fairies</FONT> but its pretty dangerous. What do you think, do you want to try it?
Leave it to me!
Not my job
Alrighty! Now go to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Spiritual Land</FONT> and defeat <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Fairies</FONT> and get <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>5 Fairy's Powders</FONT>.
Fine then. I'll ask someone else.
Hahaha... You're a funny young one! It's true you can't do anything without life.
Welcome! Want to take a look at our products? They're all good! Or... Did you hear we are in need of help?
Yes
Just looking
Our job is simple, although it may be dangerous. I've been watching you since you came here, I think you're OK. I want you to deliver a Parcel to Tomyman at Meteor Pit. Can you do that?
Alright
No I can't
Alright, take this Parcel to Tomyman in Meteor Pit.
Your inventory is full. Clean it up and come back!
That's too bad...
Enjoy choosing!
Welcome! Our products are all great and reasonable. Enjoy!
Thunder Hill Dalifon conversation
Wow, you're amazing!
....Hey, about that job you helped me with that other time, now the situation has changed. This time, it is pretty complicated.
What happened?
Sounds complicated
Remember the Demon Spider you defeated, they weren't individuals, there seems to be someone controlling them. They seem to be causing trouble to travelers again. I assume that there may be an even stronger monster nearby, it may be their boss.<PF>I want you to defeat it and report to me, can you do that? When you're done, I'll definitely reward you!
Sure
I can't handle that
Alright I'm counting on you! I believe they're at the south of <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Holy Plain</FONT>, where the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Demon Spiders</FONT> are. Search around there.
Darn! I guess everyone is afraid of unknown power. After all they are Umbra.
Yeah, that's why I'm thinking... Do you have any good idea?
Hello, there. From the last job I know I can really rely on you. How about another one? I won't disappoint you.
What do you want?
Next time?
Its an easy task. You know holy plain right? Its to the east of spiritual place, I get some of my supplies from there. These days, <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Demon Spider</FONT> seems to be causing trouble, my supply dealer is afraid and cannot deliver my supplies. Demon Spider appear near the south side of the river, can you defeat them?<PF>I think you can handle them. If you succeed, I'll reward you. What do you think?
Accept
No, Demon Spiders...
Alright, go east to the holy plains, and defeat the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Demon Spider</FONT>s! As evidence, bring <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>6 Demon Spider Fang</FONT> to me.
Darn! I guess I'll find someone else.
Grrr you! After being so nice to you, you give me that attitude. I was just trying to give you fame!
Hey! Leave me alone. If you want to buy something, talk to the other guy!  Sigh... What should I do....
Help him
Don't like his attitude
Hmmm, you're going to help me? I don't know if I can rely on you but if you say so. Here's the story. Its almost my wife's birthday. A little while ago, I purchased a ring as a gift in Meteor Pit.<pf>I went back to search the river near Spiritual Land, but couldn't find it. I think it was washed away to the river south of <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Holy Plain</FONT>. Can you possibly find it for me? Of course I'll reward you.
Leave it to me!
Too far
I'm in a rush, please! Go to the river south of <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Holy Plain</FONT> and find <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>ring case</FONT> for me!
What an unreliable person!
You really can't do anything about it?
Be quiet! If you want to purchase something, talk to the clerk.
Thunder Hill Chezla conversation
Hi! Do you want to search a guild or establish one?
Search guild
Establish guild
Feel free to look around
You are already in another guild! You must be over level 25, and not currently in any guild to establish one.
You are able to establish a guild. When doing so, you need <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>500 gold, 1000 SP, and an unused guild name</FONT>. Do you have that ready?
Yes I do
Let me think for a bit
Tell me the guild name you wish to apply to.
Alright, think well. Come back when you're ready.
You are under level 25. You must be over level 25, and not currently in any guild to establish one.

I want my son to get to get hold of himself.
Ah, good to see you again, young one.
How do you feel?
Hello
I'm fine! My legs still work, though not like they used to... Yeah, just as you say. I'm worried if Dugga is doing well over there. Oh, he might need some food, could you take this to him? And please check on his condition as well.
Not a problem
I don't feel like it
Alright then, take this pack of food to Dugga in Spiritual Land.
Your inventory is full. I wanted you to take food to him, would it be possible to make room for it?
Alright, I'll ask someone else
You're a very nice person.
Oh... son, where are you?
Something wrong?
I don't see anyone...
Young one, my son Dugga loves history and antiques. He didn't know where to start with his research at seal tower.< BR>He said he was going to search around the giant tower and never came back.<PF>If I were a little younger and healthier I would go myself to see, I even have weapons ready! Young one, you seem kind. Can you go look for him?
Leave it to me!
Not interested
Great, I knew it! When you find my son, I need to really thank you.
You're no help at all. Fine, I won't ask for your help!
Dugga...... where are you?
Dugga...... where are you?
Spiritual Land Dugga conversation
Did you come to see the giant tower?
Hey it's you again! How can I help you this time?
Sightseeing
Just walking by
I see. Well, there's been no progress for me, unfortunately.<PF>Oh, if I had my old book it would help. My father should know where it is. It's a book called Record of the Giant Tower, can you bring that to me?
Sure
Next time
Alright then. Please get the book from my father Diba at Thunder Hill.
Alright, I guess I'll continue searching without it.
You're really busy huh.
What do you want?
Meteor Pit Tomyman conversation
Its been a while, how are you doing?
Hello. You were so great the other time. Can you help me again?
Of course
No
That's great. Can you go to Spiritual Land south from here? There is a giant tower in the center. To the west of that, there is a plant called a Cocoon Herb. Cocoon Herbs are used to make potions and I want you to get me one. It's not something I need a whole bunch of, but are required to make potions.
Oh really? I guess you're busy then.
Its been a while, how are you doing?
What should I do, my son went somewhere again...
Need help?
Go and look for him!
Thank you so much! I can't leave the store so I need your help. My son is gone but I think he is within Meteor Pit. His name is Konelly, please go look for him.
You're right, I need to go immediately. But I can't leave my store open, what should I do...
Hello, how can I help you?
Looking for a job
Just looking
Oh really? I just finished making new potion, and I wanted to send a few bills to Meteor Pit but can you help me? Of course, I'll pay you.
Sure
No
Alright, can you deliver these to Blacksmith Drasky, accessory merchant Yuifon,  and weapon merchant Marthon?
Your inventory is full. Please clean it up and come back!
Is that so? I guess this job isn't attractive.
Is that so? New potions are pretty good, take a look at them.
Our new potions are great! If you need them, I'll sell them.
Meteor Pit Marthon
You have good luck, do you want something?
What's going on, looking for a job?
Sorry I'm poor!
I'm not a lucky man
Wow, how can you say such a thing. Alright, I'll give you a job. Recently, someone went through the north east of Spiritual Land and saw a shining stone. When they got closer, they were surrounded by The Four Pumpkin Brothers. It seems like they all have the stone with them... Interested? Can you get the stones for me? Please say yes.
Yes
Too lazy
Alright, I'll be waiting for you. Defeat the Four Pumpkin Brothers and look for the stones. I hope luck will be on your side again.
Of course. I didn't think that you'll count on luck again.
Hahaha... You don't want to listen to me? Damn you! People these days!
Who are you? What do you want?
Do you have a job?
I came to shop
Oh, looking for a job? Why didn't you tell me earlier! I do have a job but it may be too hard for you.<PF>You know Spiritual Land right? There's a monster called <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Shockey</FONT> there and I want you to defeat it for <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Broken Swords</FONT> . Those Broken Swords are used to make new weapons! When making new weapons, those are required!<PF>They are a powerful monster but do you want to give it a try?
I'm not scared!
Not doing this job
If you're not scared bring back <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>4 Broken Swords</FONT>!
Scared? Pretty sad. Alright, I'll find someone else.
You're in the way, if you want to shop, talk to the guy over there.
Who are you? I don't have time to spend on you!

Meteor Pit Arron conversation
Last time with your help,  we were able to get back our holy land of Meteor Pit. Thank you so much.
Oh its you, thank you for defeating the Umbra the other time.<PF>The spiritual force around the stone pillar ddisappeared when the Umbra were defeated, but how could I have expected such a thing...
Something else wrong?
I can't do anything
I think so. The reason why is that there are similar pillars in the south of <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Wastelands</FONT>. That <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>southern Wastelands</FONT> is covered with Umbra around it, it seems like the two pillar groups are having effect on each other. Either way, the northern Wastelands aren't fully purified yet.<PF>I guess the two stone pillar groups need to purified together. Need to work on it again from scratch......
I'll help out!
Good luck
You're going to help me again? That's amazing! Then can you check out <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>stone pillar group</FONT> of <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>south area of Wastelands</FONT>. There should be Umbra around it.
Thank you. I'll need to look for help.
Oh... alright. You've already helped me once so I can't ask you many times.
Oh young one. You seem to have just arrived to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Meteor Pit</FONT>. You don't know much about this place do you?
How did you know?
I know it well
Well, I didn't live long for nothing.    Meteor Pit was created by combining <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Machinist Society</FONT> and <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Warrior Society</FONT> together. That's why you'll see machine like buildings, or the symbol of Warrior Society, statues everywhere. Oh, you're not familiar with the western lands <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Wastelands</FONT> are you?<PF>The Wastelands at that place is said to have some kind of spiritual force that makes people feel good. That's why when people are depressed, they go there. It's people's holy land.  But...
But what?
Going to see the statue
But... recently I hear bad rumors. I heard that the spiritual force around the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Stone Pillars</FONT> are being polluted. It's thought to be the Umbra surrounding it that's causing it.<PF>Yes, definitely!<PF>It may be too sudden but just by looking at you, I can tell that you're a pretty skilled young one. Could you please help me purify the spiritual force and get back our holy land?
Sure, count on me!
Not worth it
Go west of Spiritual Land to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>north side of Wastelands</FONT>. There are <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Stone Pillars</FONT> placed in a circle, to the center of that there is a special stone pillar that is what I was talking about earlier. If you can defeat the Umbra around it, I think the spiritual force will be purified.
Alright. No matter what we say, you are an outsider, you wont understand how we feel.
Oh... Okay, sorry for bothering you.
I think I was misunderstanding.
Oh... Do you believe in something? The job we respect most at Warrior Society are <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Knight</FONT> and <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Demon Slayer</FONT>. You seem young so you still have a chance. I hope you will become a great one some day.
Thunder Hill Von conversation
Oh its you, how was the food last time?
Was like garbage!
It was delicious
How can you say such a thing...
Good. I was thinking of recommending that food!
Oh... I'm sorry. I still can't make that to dish taste great.
Something wrong again?
I want to try it
Well... I didn't realize till later but to complete that dish, I need a strong heat. I tried many things but still not close to completion.
Oh, there is one more way. But with my ability, its impossible. However, you may be able to do it.
What is it?
Waste of time
Um......near the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>west side of Wastelands</FONT> there's a monster called <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Locked Little Ms. Hanako</FONT>, they sometimes drop an amulet called<FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Wild Blaze Amulet</FONT>. that amulet creates high temperature flame. With that, I think I can do it.
Too far...
I'll help out!
Alright. You may have missed a wonderful dish.
Great, I think I can complete the dish!
Can't help it then...
Strange, I need more heat, more powerful one...
Darn, waiting and waiting but the ingredients from the west doesn't arrive. I cannot complete my dish like this!
Should I go take a look?
What happened?
That helps, the dealer said the road <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>westside of Wastelands</FONT> have enormous amount of Umbra causing trouble. Maybe defeating them will help get my ingredients here.
The dish I promised to present to you, seems like it will take a while. The ingredients I'm waiting for is not coming. Something has to be wrong.
Unfortunately the ingredients needed to make the dish has not arrived yet. Can you wait a little longer.
Wahaha, I've thought of a nice dish!
Are you a cook?
Can I taste?
Arr... do I not look like one? That hurts my feeling, I didn't think I wasn't looking like a cook.
Its true, come on have a taste. Oh, but I can't let you taste for free. The dish I just thought of cannot be made with ordinary ingredients. If you can get them for me, I'll treat you.
I'll go then
Never mind
You'll do it? OK. What I want is something called Narcissus Herb, adding this will change the taste dramatically! Most of <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Narcissus Herb</FONT> is found on the western land <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Wastelands</FONT>. Good luck.
Wow wow, are you just going to ignore the best dish in the world. This dish is definitely better than what the pope of Warrior Society eats everyday.
Hmmm... I wonder what kind of dish suits the title of Best dish?

How is Richard's situation?
Oh......<PF>No! The bird flew away. You made it fly away, what are you going to do?
I don't care!
What can I do?
How dare you little... Ignore what a priest says.
Umm... Let me think for a bit.<PF>Oh, since you made my bird fly away, can you deliver a message for me.<PF>This is a very important letter, deliver it as soon as possible. Otherwise... Since you caused this to happen I'm expecting you to take responsibility.
Alright...
Who cares!
Great, that's how you should be. Now deliver this message to aired security squad leader <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Richard</FONT> who is at the western area of <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Aird Field</FONT>.
Your inventory is full. Clean it up.
Oh my, what a little...
I heard that Fujin's Field is not in a good situation.
Fujin's Field Richard conversation
Meteor Pit Celine conversation
Oh its you, this place isn't very safe these days, you better be careful.
That's not good!
What happened?
I'll stay away...
Well, we've finally figured out why Drapper gathered in one place. The reason was that an even stronger monster was controlling them, but now they form groups and cause trouble. That's just not good...
Let me take care of them!
Let's run!
Oh? That's a great idea. You're a hero! Exactly as you say. But remember, that monster isn't going to be as easy as Drapper. Be careful...
Wow wow... If something happens, you just run away?
Why do you say such a thing? You have to protect the country! This problem can effect the whole world, not just a single country.
Oh, you? I've recently sent a group to investigate I didn't expect that the powerful vampires had even more powerful race within them. We call them <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Drapper</FONT>.
That powerful?
And?
Not just powerful! Attack, defense, HP everything is at a much higher level.
I want you to use guerrilla warfare on <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Drapper</FONT> to lower their numbers. We would like to assist you as soon as possible to defeat them but for now, you are our hope. This may not even be an advice but you may want to team up with someone else. They are different from normal vampires.
Oh its you, this place isn't very safe these days, you better be careful.
I think I've seen you somewhere...... Oh, I remember. These days I hear rumors about traveler that's been helping out people. From the information I hear, it is you, am I right?
Yes
Wrong person...
Just as I thought. Hmmm...... (watching from top to bottom). Traveler, being able to go through Wastelands without any damage,  you must be very skillful aren't you?
What about it?
You want me to join?
Aired security, no, Warrior Society may be in need of your help.
No, its not that. If you wanted to join the security squad, you'll need to pass an exam anyway. However, we are in need of some help so with your skill, you may qualify. This is not only for the sake of the squad, but for the sake of Warrior Society, to save the world.
How can I help?
Save the world? How old!
There's many things you can do! Recently, a bunch of slimes started gathering in one place, they seem to have some kind of plan... We security squads need to send people so that the Slimes don't come within Wastelands area. But we are in short of people, so we don't have enough force for the investigation group. I want you to do the investigation, can you?
OK, no problem!
Slime...yuck!
Alright, I knew it. Go to Fujin's Field and look deep. You'll probably run into <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Poisonous Slime</FONT> so defeat them.
Haha, if you don't want to that's fine.
Really? Young people these days...
Of course not. Or did I get old?
Strange, its getting even worse...
Fujin's Field Inias conversation
Thanks last time, I appreciate it!
Darn Fujin's Field! Since I was sent here as a guard, there's nothing good. Trouble and trouble!
Something wrong again?
That's too bad
It's a long story, I recently went to defeat some Umbra in the west with the other members. But I dropped something very important, what should I do?
Must go look
Oh, come on...
I can't, I'm not suited for fighting, I specialize in medical treatment and assisting others. That's why without the other members, I can't handle <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Mummy Mage</FONT>.
Does that mean, you're helping? Then can you please go <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>west</FONT> and defeat <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Mummy Mage</FONT> to get back my family heirloom.
Even you say that? Everyone says the same thing.
I don't understand why this place is called Fujin's Field. It's been quite a while since I came here but I've never seen birds.
I'm so useless. The things I was thinking of became reality...
How about solving the problem?
I want to know more
No no, with my ability, its impossible. But I have to repot to the top. It's all my fault, I didn't patrol that day, that lead to the spreading of the Umbra and I couldn't stop it.<PF>But you know, that <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Merrily</FONT> is insane. Its like a grudge and is really strong. A little member like me couldn't have done anything.
Need to go assist the others
No match for me!
That's right, I need to talk to the leader first.
Really?  Then if you can defeat <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Merily</FONT> at the west, I'll reward you. That way, you can make money and I don't have to get my leader mad.
From few days ago, this Fujin's Field is kind of strange. After the vampire incident, the monster's number is keep on increasing. Seems like different kind of Umbra are popping up as well.
Recently Fujin's Field is getting weird. Maybe something happened at <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Deep Lab</FONT> at north, or it could be <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Lost Cave</FONT> at south. If it is true, then we're in trouble! I hope it's not.
Darn statue gargoil......
Statue gargoil?
What happened?
Statue gargoil is a monster with hard body and sharp claw, faster than the wind and we are struggling on them.
Hmph......that statue gargoil again. My leg was scratched from the last patrol and I still can barely walk. I can't move far so I can only patrol close by. If I can just punch that statue gargoil, how would that be......
OK, no problem!
Good luck.
Really? If you can, please do so! They appear in the southern road right passed the bridge. At least that's where I met them.
Arr, until my legs are healed, I can't go for revenge.
Patrolling around here isn't interesting at all...
Increase scan fee
How dare you talk to me. What do you want? I'll tell you that if you go in the wrong direction, it's not my fault!
Level up
I want money
I want equipment
Your wish has been granted! ...... Cheater!
Your level is too high, you can't do that anymore.

Fujin's Field Kakukou conversation
I'm saved, thank you so much. Now Lost Cave will be back to normal.
Recently, this cave has problems only...
Ask what's wrong
Walk away
Young one, you're a very curious person. Alright, since you helped me twice, I'll tell you.<PF>Recently, a new monster called <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Vampirele</FONT> started to appear in the cave. I don't know if its because the spiritual force have changed, or was it summoned by someone. The important thing is, someone has to stop this situation. I already figured out that monster comes from <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Monster jar</FONT> within the cave. But unfortunately I can't break it, can you help me again?
Help
Deny
Great. We have to guard this place so we can't move. I need you to go to Thunder Hill to meet <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Oumou</FONT>, and request for <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Sealed Powder</FONT>. I believe you can find him at Wizard's cave.
I didn't expect you to be that cold at that age. I can't stop crying. Why... Why... Can you be such a person...
How rude...
Hope he cools down
Oh... I was... So, are you interested in the situation of the cave? Then I shall tell you.<PF>The spiritual force has been polluted and is affecting the seal process. That means there is a chance that he might run away. If we can get rid of the Umbra... Since this cave has lots of water and high purification power, it can definitely weaken the problem.
Go for it
Leave immediately
Then go to the cave and defeat <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Cave Water Imp</FONT>. You can find them near the water, maybe they are the ones polluting the water.
Really? You're pretty busy then.
Oh... Need to look a little longer.
*sigh*, I hear their scream again... It's been happening a lot recently - the situation seems bad. Did you hear it too? It's a long story, and I don't want to cause panic, so please don't tell anybody about this.<PF>Anyway, the Lost Cave was us Mage Spiritual's training ground. That was because the cave gathered a lot of Spiritual Energy. However, we Mage Spiritual got caught in an unexpected event, leaving us no choice but to use the power Spiritual Energy of the cave to seal the powerful monster into the depths of the cave. I was placed here to watch over that monster. Recently his howls have become more frequent, making me think the Spiritual Energy of the cave is diminishing, and perhaps it will no longer hold him in... Yes, that must be it... Perhaps this is his about to break the seal and revive. It could just be me though, and I guess it is essential that we look into it.
Help investigate
Don't bother
Oh that helps. The truth is I can't leave this place If I leave and if the Umbra run out, that will be a problem. Even if I were to get help from Thunder Hill, that will take time and something may happen.<PF>I've already placed pearls that <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Stone Cave Bat</FONT> like. If they eat my <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Memory Pearl</FONT>, you'll find out the situation of the cave.
Oh... You look depressed but don't worry. If something happens, I'll call for help.
Young one, you shouldn't enter this cave. You might die!
Thunder Hill Oumou conversation
With your help, Lost Cave was saved. You may not be a Mage but the Mage spiritual welcomes you.
With your help, Lost Cave was saved.
Wow, my fortune telling giving a vague result. In the near future, there will be a disaster in the far west lands. Which is something with high relevance to Mage spiritual. Could it be... Something happened at Lost Cave?
Go and ask him
Stay quiet
I don't know what to say, just that the Lost Cave guard <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Kakukou</FONT> may know something. If you're interested, why don't you go ask him?
Accept
Deny
Oh, that's great. Can you go to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Kakukou</FONT> at Fujin's Field, and tell him that some kind of disaster will occur. He should be at the entrance of Lost Cave.
That's too bad, I'll think of another way.
You don't believe in fortune telling, that's fine. Time will tell us the truth.
This is the Mages spiritual holy sanctuary. Usually outsiders aren't allowed here, but you are special.
Thank you for waiting! Just finished making seal powder. Now can you go for a run? I can make these kind of stuff but can't fight. I can't go through Fujin's Field.
Accept
Deny
Oh great, take this powder to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Kakukou</FONT> at <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Fujin's Field</FONT>. He should be in front of Lost Cave.
Yes... this isn't good.
This is the Mages spiritual cave. Inside there is a holy sanctuary, but if you're not a Mage, please don't go near it.
Spiritual Church BF1 Admoff conversation
I didn't expect that the cyborg at Deep Lab had a relationship with principal Mad. That artificial living organism had a flaw so it was thrown out. That's why it went out of control and attacked people, and took over..................
As a scientist, I need to seek the truth. Deep Lab contains principal's experiments that attack people. From that, it is said that Deep Lab was fallen, but there is no evidence. I am planning on investigating why Deep Lab has been abandoned , do you want to help me?
Interesting
Not interested
Right? Interesting right? Before we begin, we need to know more about the situation at Deep Lab. I want you to take this letter to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Catlina</FONT> who is guarding Deep Lab at <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Fujin's Field</FONT>. When she reads this letter, she should help you out.
Your inventory is full. You can't fit my letter.
Alright, so only scientists seek the truth.
As a scientist, you just have to want to know the truth.
Fujin's Field Catlina conversation
Now I finally found out the truth, but a little sad......
Whatever people say, after all this incident, we were able to know why Deep Lab was ruined.<PF>Now, can you go back and report to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Admoff</FONT>? He will definitely write a book on your adventure.
Alright
I don't want to meet him
Now go back to my brother <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Admoff</FONT> at meteor pit <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Spiritual Church</FONT>.
Alright, then I'll go to him myself.
I finally finished reading the lab report. According to the report, that mad principal created an artificial life. I think... It's like a cyborg or something, but weird! Does that mean genius and mad people are alike?
I guess
Is this helping?
Don't you think so? He didn't just create artificial life, he probably had some other plan. Whatever it is, we normal people wouldn't understand what a crazy guy is thinking.
Of course it's helping, we are getting closer to our goal aren't we? Maybe this artificial life... No, I should say cyborg. Could that have caused Deep Lab to be destroyed? Don't you want to know?
Yes
You're going off track
If you go to Deep Lab and find this cyborg, the problem may be solved.
How did it lead to that? Are you saying we did this for nothing?
I'm sorry, I'm not done reading the records.
Finally finished analyzing. It seems like the Umbra weren't originally living here, something brought them here.
Like what?
And then...?
I'm not sure. But I think this will lead to the next hint.
Alright, we should check the lab report. There might be information on why Umbra were brought. It may be the cyborg that lost control, or even a result from an unsuccessful experiment.<PF>Whatever it is, thinking here is no use. That's why I want you to look for the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>lab report</FONT>. I would like to go as well but I will be no help.
Still not done analyzing, it will take some more time.
Let's talk about what we should do next. Otherwise the Umbra will gather again.
Got it!
Wait a while
According to the records, Deep Lab has been abandoned after the cyborgs that principal made went out of control. In theory, it shouldn't affect the investigation.<PF>Deep Lab has been abandoned for a long time. We don't know when Umbra started to take over the school, and started living here For the first step, lets take a look at this monster. If it succeed, we can get some hint from the Umbra that pop out.
Don't make me wait so long.
Are you investigating about Deep Lab?
Are you investigating about Deep Lab?

Five elements conversation
I am too old and about to die... At least I've got my books with me.   Hey hey... Where was I...oh     You look new. What are you doing here?
What are you looking?
Can you teach me something?
Oh, I was reading 'history of spirits and land'. I tried to find a way to get the five elements out of <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Tower of Remains</FONT> and spread them to other places but...
Then, what is the result?
Why do you read such boring stuff?
Unfortunately, I, by myself, cannot disobey natural laws. Let it be.
Boring? I am crazy about horoscope! Everything could be predicted by horoscope!   But I was always wrong, maybe I am old...
Oh! You are still interested? I am so moved. Then, which part do you want to rehearse? The beginner's calendar or the influences of five elements?
The influences of Five Elements
The calendar
We are controlled by five elements, which are <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>gold</FONT>, <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>wood</FONT>, <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>water</FONT>, <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>fire</FONT>, and <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>earth</FONT>. Everything in the world has its own character.
Character?
Character sounds romantic, it actually means<FONT COLOR=#00ff00>weakness</FONT>.    Usually we can easily tell earth, water and fire. Do you know that gold and wood are in the thunder and wind?
Basically, the five elements are lined up according to their weakness:   gold -> wood -> earth -> water -> fire. If you can make your strategy according to this order you will be more successful.
Our calendar are divided into 8 months with 7 days each month. You will find it in the small map. You need to read a lot of books before understanding it. The books are in the library.
I won't waste your time.      The idea that the 8 month calendar was calculated by scientists however, is a myth.
I can share my study of the beginner's calendar and the five elements. There are a lot of unknown myths.
Sounds difficult
They look very interesting
It looks simple until you study it deeply.    What? You are bored? What do young people turn into now.

Go explore the unknown world! It's so nice you're helping me with this.
You are such a good assistant! Hahahahahaha...
Nah...
....oh...
Hi, you come again! I am bored right now!
Any progress?
How can I leave here?
Nah...therefore I am so bored.
Do you need something?
I've thought about that before, but it won't be exciting anymore.
Oh, I heard that advisors from two villages all have some troubles and difficulties. Would you ask around to see what it is?
You want to help them?
No. Just trying to give you some ideas. You have some reputation in the Beginner's Village. You shouldn't waste your talent only in this village.

No. I just felt that I've already spent so much time on that formula. In fact, it's proved that this one on the second page of my Note Paper works!
Your Notes are so thick!
Yeah. Only my formula is reaching 200 kinds, but the Soul Lab thinks they are too dangerous. They won't let me use them, so my thesis is not approved yet.
How dangerous are they?
Explosive Medicine, Poison, Fury Medicine, Berserker Medicine...etc.
......
Why frown, these types of medicine are very common.     Listen, <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Jillydug</FONT> the old man, <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Jidy</FONT>, and the sensitive <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Belkana</FONT> are in trouble, we should help.
How would you help them?
Just help me to check if they are ok. I don't want to bother them.     Jillydug and Belkana are in the <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Trial Cave</FONT>. Jidy is too scared to go to, so he stays <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>outside</FONT> crying. You will need my medicine.
Alright, I'll go!
I don't want to waste my time
Then, I look forward to hearing from you. Remember, don't interfere. Just ask around what  happened, I am just curious.
I am not short of it.
I heard that <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Jillydug</FONT> the old man, <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Jidy</FONT>, and the sensitive <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Belkana</FONT> are in trouble! We should help.

You are here again. It seems like I've got a good assistant.
Don't flatter yourself.
What else can I do for you?
Whatever. Your visit told me you are still interested in this formula.
Then, I don't want to help you anymore
What should I do?
You're not? Bye.
Next, I will test some formula. If you don't wanna help, please leave.
It seems very interesting
I knew you'd like it!
However, when I am making the medicine, you need to get some <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Slime Jelly</FONT> for me, after you get enough <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Slime Jelly</FONT>, I will finish the medicine.
Next, I will test some formulas. If you don't wanna help, please leave.
I'm leaving. Bye!
What should I do?
OK. Then, this is it.
I like your attitude. when I am making the medicine, you need to get some <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Slime Jelly</FONT> for me. After you get enough <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Fruit Jello</FONT>, I will finish the medicine.
Let's start.
I am a graduate student in the Soul Lab. As a student in Science, it is logical for me to research new formulas.
Alright, alright, whatever
I don't have time
Great, I hope everyone should be like you!...     Hey! Hold on! I should tell you what to prepare first!
No time? I will ask for someone else then.
I can't believe it. This formula is not dangerous. Why didn't I pass the last exam?
You are not qualified to help me. You should gain more experience first.

You've finished the second job transfer! Work even harder in the future!
You've got some good experience, but your occupation is not fit for me. You should go explore your own society.
It seems it is not your time yet. Train harder! Success is on its way!
In your opinion, what is the ultimate philosophy of a samurai?
Loyalty first!
Become strong!
I am glad that you want to serve the pope. I believe that <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Saint Soldier</FONT>  is your perfect profession.
Saint Soldier it is!
Saint Soldier? Not for me.
<FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Saint Soldier</FONT>... has strong belief and is loyal to the pope forever! You can learn the most powerful magic in the world!
Correct. This is what I want.
I have to think it over.
To prove your loyalty to the Church, you should kill the guy who dishonored the Church.
Who is it?
I have to think it over.
Great! He lives in <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Map O</FONT>, named <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Merrily</FONT>! If you could <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>kill 3 of them</FONT>, <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Saint Soldier</FONT> will accept you...

If you are selfish and would try anything to be stronger! Then, I believe Demon Hunter is your best occupation.
I want to be it!
I don't want to be it!
<FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Demon Hunter</FONT>... is not serving the pope any more! They study black magic in order to increase their power to kill demons. They are walking edge between right and wrong!
Correct. This is what I want
I have to think it over.
Strength and ability is what demon hunters are looking for! They may even perform evil deeds to become stronger. Are you sure this is what you want?
Correct. This is what I want
I have to think it over.
Then, I believe in your determination! But you still have to show me your ability. If you could pass my test, then you could prove your ability! Do you have the courage to do so?
Of course. I do!

Wa! Never thought you're so strong! Come on! I wish you would strive more in your future!
You... don't seem to be suited for this occupation. You should look for your own society.
Don't rush... be patient and follow the steps to be successful! Come on!
In your opinion, what is the ultimate philosophy of chemist?
Follow the norm
Pursue advanced magic
If you are struck and only use mainstream magic, I think <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Taoist</FONT> is your perfect profession!
Yes! I want to be a Taoist!
I don't want to be a Taoist
<FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Taoists</FONT> are strong against black magic and they only use mainstream magic. They are quick learners and gain spirit quickly!
Correct. This is what I want

In order to prove yourself, go to <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Map Q</FONT> and find <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Little Mr. Breeze</FONT>,  that has been disturbing the village all the time...

Demon Riders study black magic in cult, Umbra are not all bad to them. They won't kill them unless it is necessary...
This is what I want to be
I don't want to be it
<FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Demon Riders</FONT> study black magics in a cult. They know the secrets of using spirit to increase their power. They can kill or cure the demon with peaceful methods. They can also raise the 'Dog God' to work for them.

Are you sure Demon Rider is what you want to be? Without any regret?
Yes, this is what I want to be

Very good! One more brave man in the world... so good!

You have a bright future... Don't feel anxious! More practice is good for you!
In your opinion, what is the ultimate goal of the Machinist?

If you want to use magic potions and medicine bomb to kill demons and Umbra, then I believe <FONT COLOR=#00ff00>Chemist</FONT> is perfect for you!
I want to be a Chemist!
No! I don't want to be
